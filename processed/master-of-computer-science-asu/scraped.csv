Students should not try to convert their GPA on their application.âChevron RightCan English proficiency be waived off for people with work experience in US?âIf you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident, you do not need to demonstrate English proficiency. We require all international applicants from a country whose native language is not English or applicants whose undergraduate degree was not at a U.S institution to provide the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or Pearson English PTE scores. The MCS program requires a minimum score of 575 (paper-based) or 90 (internet-based) on the TOEFL exam, or a 7 for IELTS, or a 65 for PTE. English proficiency waivers are offered for degrees from certain countries. English proficiency will also be waived if you have completed at least 9 credit hours of graduate course work with a cumulative GPA of 3.00 on a 4.00 scale or higher (all credits must be earned in the U.S. and official transcripts must be mailed to ASU). If you need to take an English proficiency test for your application but are unable to take the TOEFL or IELTS, please contact us toll-free at 1-844-353-7953 or email mcsenrollment@asu.edu for options.
