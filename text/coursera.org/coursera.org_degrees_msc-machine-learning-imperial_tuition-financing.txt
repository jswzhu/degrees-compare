Tuition feesAt a total cost of Â£32,400 for a top master's degree, the MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning costs less than most of the traditional on-campus alternatives and much less than other top online programmes for international (non UK/European) students. Students can keep their commitments while earning the degree, studying online on their own schedule.Tuition fees are the same for all students (UK and overseas).Please note that fees are charged by year of entry to the College and not year of study. Except where otherwise indicated, the fees for students on courses lasting more than one year will increase annually by an amount linked to inflation, including for part-time students on modular programmes. The measure of inflation used will be the Retail Price Index (RPI) value in the April of the calendar year in which the academic session starts e.g. the RPI value in April 2023 will apply to fees for the academic year 2023â2024.Financial AidTuition ReimbursementStudents are encouraged to seek tuition reimbursement through their employer.
