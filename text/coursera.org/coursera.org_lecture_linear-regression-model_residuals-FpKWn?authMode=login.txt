These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnStatistics, Linear Regression, R Programming, Regression AnalysisReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Star4.8 (1,634 ratings)5 stars80.23%4 stars16.03%3 stars2.93%2 stars0.24%1 star0.55%MMSep 26, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Starlinear regression is well taught throughout the course, but I think learning other types of regression modeling would be useful as well and adding them to the course materials is really good.Helpful?ANSep 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course is structured in a very informative way, it is easy to understand and at the same time difficult concepts are presented in a very easy way. The course instructor is awesome.Helpful?From the lessonLinear RegressionIn this week weâll introduce linear regression. Many of you may be familiar with regression from reading the news, where graphs with straight lines are overlaid on scatterplots. Linear models can be used for prediction or to evaluate whether there is a linear relationship between two numerical variables.

Residuals are basically leftovers from the model fit.  So we can think about our observed data as the model fit plus the residuals.  The residual is defined as the difference between the observed and the predicted Y.  So the observed value and the predicted value of the  response variable for a given data point in our dataset.  So we can write the formula for the residual as and we denote it  using an E for error, EI is equal to YI, the observed response variable.  Minus Y hat I, the predicted response variable.  We're going to focus on two data points, Rhode Island and DC.  The observed poverty level in Rhode Island is around  10%, and the predicted poverty level is slightly over 14%.  The difference between these two, which is shown with  the yellow line on the plot, is the residual.  And what the residual tells us that, the  percentage of those living in poverty in Rhode  Island is 4.16% less than predicted, or in  other words, less than what this model predicts.  Similarly in D.C., the observed value is high up around 17%.  While the predicted value is much lower, around 11%, so  this time the residual is telling us something slightly different.  In this case, the percentage living in  poverty in D.C. is 5.44% more than predicted.  So the model overestimates the poverty level in  Rhode Island and underestimates the poverty level in DC.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
