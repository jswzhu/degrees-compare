It can be divided in to several short videos. Seeing a long video is creating a boredom. Otherwise it is a very nice course.Helpful?ANApr 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course materials and lecture delivery was just one of a kind,I have learnt a complete skill on Machine Learning and its Algorithms.I hope this will lead me towards a next level of Data science.Helpful?See all 5 star reviewsFilter by:All LearnersChevron DownAll StarsChevron DownSort by:  Most HelpfulChevron Down1451 - 1475 of 1,512 Reviews for Getting Started with AWS Machine LearningFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Sagar Sâ¢Jul 10, 2020Need practical assigmentsThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Akash Sâ¢May 18, 2020It was awesome course .This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Abheeshth mâ¢May 4, 2020i was  expecting moreThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Dipak Gâ¢Jul 26, 2020to much videos onlyThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Sudeep Dâ¢May 31, 2020very rudimentary This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Pratiksha R Tâ¢May 18, 2020proper content This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Jyothi Gâ¢Apr 22, 2020not satisfied This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Saaksshi Tâ¢Feb 28, 2020ok ok course.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Varun Tâ¢Oct 10, 2019Good basicsThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy taka nâ¢Oct 14, 2019too easyThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Rohit Gâ¢Apr 23, 2020HappyThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy VENNELAGANTI Sâ¢Feb 7, 2022GOODThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Adithyan T Sâ¢May 14, 2021EasyThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Milind Lâ¢Dec 21, 2020goodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Yugandhar Câ¢Jun 12, 2020GoodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Shivamâ¢Jun 6, 2020Good This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Yavuz Aâ¢May 17, 2020I enjoyed watching the lectures and learning about the features of AWS within the course context. However, I think the course was lacking an important aspect of learning; hands-on experience. If you can provide modules where people taking the course can follow along on AWS that will significantly boost the learning experience. That said, earning a certificate for the course was very easy. For the certificate to have a credibility, I believe the quizzes should be more challenging and passing them by just guess-work needs to be eliminated by asking different questions on each attempt. I enrolled for this course using a Coursera promotion and I haven't paid anything for the certificate. I would feel terribly bad if I paid for it. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Andrii Oâ¢Jul 11, 2020This is just an advertisement, not a course. The narrative "This course will teach you how to get started with AWS Machine Learning" is completely wrong as the course just shows features available in AWS and very short examples. The course is chaotic. It not understandable why to get the certificate I need to pay money. The value of this certificate probably is very low (0).This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy mohammad h hâ¢Aug 10, 2020If you want to learn algorithms or coding, its not the one, this course helps you know what kind of possibilities AWS has, and I think its an advertisement course, so at the end, you know what they have.This course doesn't even have some labs that you could try some of AWS Possibilities, "you'll know what they have in AWS," and that's all for five weeks!This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Jon Mâ¢Nov 12, 2019There seemed to be wide variation in the level of technical detail in the various segments covered by different instructors.   The course tended to focus too much on image/video recognition rather than text analysis.   The 3 question quizzes did not offer a good cross-section of the material covered, the quizzes should include at least 10 questions.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Bivas Dâ¢Dec 15, 2019The quality and delivery of this course is not what I expected from AWS. This course almost seems like cut and paste of several different training materials into one course and published on Coursera. AWS can do better if they expect people to adopt their tools and platforms, which it seems the intent of the course is.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Collin Eâ¢Apr 11, 2020This course is an overview of the services Amazon provides for running machine learning in the cloud. It does not do much to teach you about how the algorithms work, it is only high level. There is no hands-on assignments to help learning, only simple quizzes.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Wan Aâ¢Apr 26, 2020I felt like this course is designed for ML expert. It focused to much on using AWS ML services but lack of lab or sandboxes where we could follow along. Besides, this course felt a lot more like an advertisement of Amazon services.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Ben Lâ¢May 22, 2020Basically a giant advert for Amazon services (maybe unsurprisingly); would have been better if it provided rough cost estimates for the case studied provided. On the plus side, I feel I understand amazon's offerings better.  This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Deleted Aâ¢May 11, 2020I feel this course is a mash up from many AWS courses, which have little to no continuity whatsoever. Instructors feel very robotic, and reading the documentation for AWS might be even better than taking this course.This is helpful Chevron Left 1 ... 51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61 Chevron Right
