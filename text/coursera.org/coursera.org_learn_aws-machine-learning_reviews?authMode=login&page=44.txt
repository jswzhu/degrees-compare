It can be divided in to several short videos. Seeing a long video is creating a boredom. Otherwise it is a very nice course.Helpful?ANApr 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course materials and lecture delivery was just one of a kind,I have learnt a complete skill on Machine Learning and its Algorithms.I hope this will lead me towards a next level of Data science.Helpful?See all 5 star reviewsFilter by:All LearnersChevron DownAll StarsChevron DownSort by:  Most HelpfulChevron Down1076 - 1100 of 1,512 Reviews for Getting Started with AWS Machine LearningFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Animeshâ¢May 21, 2021The content of this course is good but the instructors lack some energy.

However, the course lacked some hands-on exercises, so one less star. But still, I will recommend for those who wish to get started with this technology.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Tal Bâ¢Oct 10, 2020Very interesting and well-produced! I must say I imagined some more hands-on examples, maybe even examples which would allow me to actually perform some modeling and so on.All in all, it was a great experience which made me want to learn more about ML.Thank you!This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Kartik Jâ¢May 11, 2021The course is great to understand the basics of machine learning ,Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning as it gives overview on all of that .The back point is that it is not project based ,if there is project involved then it become great course to learn.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy vince câ¢Jan 5, 2021Good for an introduction which I needed.However, the version is not necessarily the same that is available with SageMaker. So, there were some differences making it sometimes confusing to follow an example. But, I recommend the course, as its very good.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Martin Iâ¢Nov 5, 2019Great overview of AWS Machine Learning although it would be great to see further working examples of how this can be applied to processes in Financial Services, such as automating customer call trees, reducing processing time for manual reconciliations.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Gary Tâ¢Oct 27, 2019With no prior ML experience, the course provided a good overview of AWS services and showcased the abilities of each.  It's really an eye opener to see how far AI & ML have progressed and what can be accomplished in a fairly short period of time.  This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Haider Râ¢Apr 6, 2020It was a good course and even the instructors were good. I have just one suggestion that please try to make the videos a little more happening because they sometimes felt like a lecture and not some online interactive course This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy JosÃ© A Sâ¢Jun 21, 2020I think some topics need to be updated, there are long videos that can be divided into tasks.
