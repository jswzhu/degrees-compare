Career OutcomesMSc in Innovation and EntrepreneurshipThis program is geared towards those who want to start their own business or understand the best techniques for advancing innovation in any organization. You will learn the basics of business management, leadership, and the requirements for planning and creating new enterprises, whether within a single country or internationally. You will also become well-grounded in the ideal approaches to financing a new business and developing a thorough understanding of the fundamentals and complexities that are inherent to the role of manager. You will master the tools necessary for launching businesses or working in advisory roles to new venture start-ups. Youâll also gain practical experience in commercialisation and build proficiency with the tools to proactively work in projects in highly uncertain or risky market environments.This degree is designed to foster a creative and entrepreneurial mindset. As a graduate of this program, youâll be prepared to pursue careers such as company founder, customer experience manager, innovation consultant, business development manager, and more.Executive MSc in Innovation and EntrepreneurshipGraduates of this program are able to commercialize ideas and pursue successful career opportunities as entrepreneurs. A third of the capstone projects created by students from the first cohort are already morphing into innovative startups.Current students are applying lessons gleaned from classes even before graduating: âElements of all the courses came up in conversations and gave me a distinct competitive advantage,â said Dennis Zaidi, referencing the Elite French Graduate School Entrepreneur Challenge he won in November. Zaidi triumphed due to his pitch promoting Clean Lakes startup, a social entrepreneurship company aimed at removing pollution in Canadaâs Great Lakes. âThe MSIE courses gave me the specific bodies of knowledge and vocabulary to communicate my idea from the perspective of C-Level decision makers.â Zaidi goes on to enumerate qualities extricated from MSIE courses such as Management of a Growing Enterprise (Sebastian Becker), Social Enterprise (Florian Hoos) and customer-centric marketing (Marc Vanhuele, Frederic Dalsace and Corinne Dauger). âTo be honest, there are aspects of every single course that played a roleâ¦ These techniques are actually rarely properly implemented or utilized in the startup world.âThis lifelong learning program, which has a BAC+5 level (European level I/EQF 7), has been awarded a Visa by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research via the CEFDG (Commission d'Ãvaluation des Formations et DiplÃ´mes de Gestion). The official title of this degree program is: âDiplÃ´me en Innovation et Entrepreneuriatâ. You must complete the 120 ECTS credits to obtain the degree.
