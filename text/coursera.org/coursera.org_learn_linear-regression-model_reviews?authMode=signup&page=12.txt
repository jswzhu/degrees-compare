These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio....

The main critique I have to offer is the lack of emphasis of using the power of R. When teaching model selection, the course should have at least provided instructionâor at least a written resourceâon how to write the R code for automating forward/backward selection by R^2.* Being a course about using R as well as about linear regression and modeling, it seems like the appropriate thing to do.(*A classmate whose final project I peer-reviewed used for loops to run the forward model selection based on R^2. That's how I learned about it.)This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Liam J Kâ¢Mar 19, 2020Overall it covers everything that you would want this course to.However, I was a complete beginner when starting this course, and as a result I regularly got confused (especially when it came to coding in R)3/5 stars for meThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Brandon Fâ¢Oct 16, 2017Provides a good overview, but I felt some loose ends were not addressed in terms of how stringent the conditions need to be met, and if one can use MLR when this is not the case.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Maeve Bâ¢Jul 12, 2022some labs and quizzes not labelled correctly i.e. week 1 quiz in week2, week 1 and 2 lab in week 3This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Jingyi Yâ¢Nov 8, 2019lectures are great. but no tutor answers my question posted in discussion board.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Zhao Lâ¢Aug 9, 2016Covers the basic of Linear Regression, would like to see more advanced material.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Kshitij Tâ¢Nov 3, 2017Only contains linear regression as opposed to other model typesThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy æ¥¼å¸â¢Aug 20, 2019The grading is just so annoyingThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Stan Mâ¢Feb 15, 2021droppedThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Farabe K Aâ¢Jun 16, 2020AverageThis is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Jyotir Pâ¢May 3, 2020The course required no prerequisites,  but no one can complete the course without actually completing the courses preceding this in the specializing series.This is helpful Chevron Left 1 ... 3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13 Chevron Right
