You will learn how to set up and perform hypothesis tests, interpret p-values, and report the results of your analysis in a way that is interpretable for clients or the public. Using numerous data examples, you will learn to report estimates of quantities in a way that expresses the uncertainty of the quantity of interest. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The course introduces practical tools for performing data analysis and explores the fundamental concepts necessary to interpret and report results for both categorical and numerical dataFlexible deadlinesFlexible deadlinesReset deadlines in accordance to your schedule.Shareable CertificateShareable CertificateEarn a Certificate upon completion100% online100% onlineStart instantly and learn at your own schedule.Beginner LevelBeginner LevelHours to completeApprox. 16 hours to completeAvailable languagesEnglishSubtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, German, Russian, English, SpanishCould your company benefit from training employees on in-demand skills?Try Coursera for BusinessSkills you will gainStatistical InferenceStatistical Hypothesis TestingR ProgrammingFlexible deadlinesFlexible deadlinesReset deadlines in accordance to your schedule.Shareable CertificateShareable CertificateEarn a Certificate upon completion100% online100% onlineStart instantly and learn at your own schedule.Beginner LevelBeginner LevelHours to completeApprox. 16 hours to completeAvailable languagesEnglishSubtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, German, Russian, English, SpanishCould your company benefit from training employees on in-demand skills?Try Coursera for BusinessInstructorInstructor rating 4.78/5Â (264 Ratings)Mine Ãetinkaya-RundelAssociate Professor of the PracticeDepartment of Statistical Science 354,730 Learners 7 CoursesOffered byDuke UniversityDuke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge.

This week we will discuss formal hypothesis testing and relate testing procedures back to estimation via confidence intervals. These topics will be introduced within the context of working with a population mean, however we will also give you a brief peek at what's to come in the next two weeks by discussing how the methods we're learning can be extended to other estimators. We will also discuss crucial considerations like decision errors and statistical vs. practical significance. The labs for this week will illustrate concepts of sampling distributions and confidence levels.Hours to complete3 hours to completeReading7 videos (Total 59 min), 5 readings, 3 quizzesSee AllVideo7 videosAnother Introduction to Inference4mHypothesis Testing (for a mean)14mHT (for the mean) examples9mInference for Other Estimators10mDecision Errors8mSignificance vs. Confidence Level6mStatistical vs. Practical Significance7mReading5 readingsLesson Learning Objectives10mLesson Learning Objectives10mWeek 2 Suggested Readings and Practice Exercises10mWeek 2 Lab Instructions (RStudio)10mWeek 2 Lab Instructions (RStudio Cloud)10mQuiz3 practice exercisesWeek 2 Practice Quiz30mWeek 2 Quiz16mWeek 2 Lab30mWeek4Week  4Hours to complete4 hours to completeInference for Comparing MeansWelcome to Week Three of the course!
