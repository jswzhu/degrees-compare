Who is this degree for?This degree offers multiple pathways to meet the needs of learners from a variety of backgrounds; for example, students just starting a career in data science and those already working in roles such as senior data analysts, bioinformatics scientists, statisticians, and data scientists.  Graduates are likely to pursue roles as data scientists, machine learning engineers, natural language processing engineers, data engineers, bioinformatics or health data scientists, AI engineers, or software engineers. Possibilities extend beyond this list, however, as machine learning is slowly becoming indispensable in other fields, such as journalism or tourism.  This is a rigorous programme; applicants are expected to have a quantitative undergraduate degree in a subject like computer science, math, statistics, economics, or physics.  Masterâs level study is a progression from undergraduate work and is usually more specialised, interdisciplinary, or orientated to a specific profession. It is more intellectually demanding and challenging than undergraduate study. Students sometimes fail to appreciate the intense and demanding nature of Master's level programmes. There is no gradual introduction â the pace is fierce from the outset and it does not subside until the end. This requires a commitment to a sustained period of intensive work right from the start. In addition:  the pace of lecturing is likely to be significantly faster you will be expected to undertake more directed background reading during the course you will be expected to arrive at solutions for yourself For this reason the College requires a high academic standard of those seeking admission. International students, in particular, should also recognise the need to be proficient in English at the start of the programme, hence the College's English language requirement.Cohorts and DeadlinesApplications are open for the Fall 2023 cohort!Application RequirementsApplicants for the degree programme must have:At least a 2.1 Bachelorâs DegreeAt least a 2.1 Bachelorâs Degree in Statistics, Mathematics, Engineering or Physics.
