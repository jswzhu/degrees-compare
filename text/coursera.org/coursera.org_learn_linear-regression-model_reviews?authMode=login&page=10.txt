These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio....

Note: It was hard, because it was difficult, but in the process i learnt a lot of things investigating.Besides this point, the course is really good to say: "I know the basics of linear regression, I know how to handle it in R", the topic of "Linear Regression and Modeling" is of course much, much more larger than what can be explained in 1 course.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Neeraj K Pâ¢Feb 8, 2017First, this course will enable me to understand the quantitative part of a research. Additionally, this will help a student to understand the essence of performing such numerical calculations and will make us understand the relationship between different variables.Secondly, this is the need of the hour and such numerical functions are used worldwide so, learning this course will help in almost every field be it 'Management' be it 'Social Sciences' or be it 'Human Behaviour'. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Veliko Dâ¢Oct 20, 2019The course is good and the material is presented clearly. The capstone project is very good and makes you really use all the knowledge obtained in the course and the pre-prequisite course Inferral Statistics. My only dissatisfaction is that the course was rather short: only 3 weeks of material and 1 capstone. Therefor it covered less material then I expected. For example, I expected logistic regression  to be covered. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Î£ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï Îâ¢Jan 17, 2022Very good course and material overall - although a little lighter in content compared to the previous one (Inferential Statistics). I think you get a good intro to linear regression and getting to apply the knowledge in the assignment is very helpful.
Beware though as the message boards are empty and it's very unlikely that you will get any questions answered. That's a serious issue with this class.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Jason Lâ¢Jan 27, 2021Awesome course with very clear material! I do wish that the course had a bit broader of a scope (i.e. also covering logistic regression and other kinds of regression with non-numerical response variables). Compared to the Inferential Statistics course, it feels like there was a bit less material. Otherwise, I was very happy with this course. :)This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Saif U Kâ¢Jul 20, 2016An extremely good introductory course. A must for undergraduates. The style of teaching is fluid and you learn concepts step by step. For more advanced learners the only drawback I see is that this is, by default, an introductory course.But still for advanced learners it can be a great (and I really mean great) refresher.

This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Artur A Bâ¢May 10, 2017The material is very straightforward and gives a great introduction to multiple linear regression. My only reservation is the length of the course, which seems to be a bit shorter than other courses in the certification. Would love to have more material/in-depth exposure to components available to us in R.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Albert Hâ¢Jul 20, 2020It's a nice overview of linear regression but I feel like there needs to be more time spent on model selection processes, collinearity/confounding/intermediate variables, and interaction terms.  It's super important for accurate model building for research purposes.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Aaradhya Gâ¢Jan 7, 2020Again, Dr. Mine Cetinkaya Rundel is amazing. However, linear regression is a vast topic, and maybe another week could have been better. But nonetheless, the concepts explained herein are crystal clear, succinct, and taught in an engaging manner.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Sean Tâ¢Jul 4, 2018Really enjoyed this course! It teaches you the theory you need to understand how a linear regression model works, how to check that your model fulfils certain conditions so that it is valid, and how to build and implement your model in practice!This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Richard N B Aâ¢Nov 9, 2016Great introduction to linear regression. Nice, clean R tutorials via the labs. The lectures do become a little monotonous, but there there are linked readings in a nice, open-source textbook if reading suits you better than listening.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Tomasz Jâ¢Oct 15, 2017Very good and gentle introduction to linear regression. The final assignment however uses dataset which is very risky to use with linear regression (not all conditions were met in all the assignments I rated!). This is confusing.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Aditya Vâ¢Apr 26, 2020A great course on regression. Though some topics weren't taught in the lecture but they can be easily covered using the links provided in the course. Additionally, a more detailed lecture on diagnostics plot can be useful.
