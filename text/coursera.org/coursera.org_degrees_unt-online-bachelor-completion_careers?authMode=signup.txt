Career OutcomesThe career paths for B.A.A.S. students vary as much as their paths toward earning the degree. Some students complete their degree in order to move ahead in their current job. Others want to change career paths altogetherâor even attend graduate school. Whatever the motivation, B.A.A.S. students graduate with an array of skills that equip them to compete in todayâs ever-changing workplace.B.A.A.S. on-campus alumni go on to hold managerial positions in business, administration, education, sales and more. They are also found in teaching and project management roles. Alumni of the B.A.A.S. are recognized for their skills in public speaking, management, leadership, research, and problem solving and are currently working at places like Bank of America, Walmart, American Airlines, J.P. Morgan and more.The majority of students pursuing the B.A.A.S. degree are currently working full-time. Networking with individual classmates can open the door to career opportunities. Students use the Slack platform to complete group work, ask questions, and network. Students who complete the Google IT Support Professional Certificate on Coursera can receive credit toward the information technology concentration of the B.A.A.S. degree. These credits would count as lower division credits. Your advisor will assess whether or how these credits may be able to count towards your degree plan. Developed by Google, the program is designed to prepare learners for an entry-level job in IT support in under six months. Learners are introduced to troubleshooting and customer service, as well as networking, operating systems, system administration, automation, and security. With this new pathway, learners can pursue a career in IT while working toward a full bachelorâs degree.Alumni NetworkYou can also become a member of the UNT Alumni Associationâover 430,000 members strongâgaining lifetime access to career services, invitations to participate in networking events, and discounts on UNT Alumni Association events throughout the year.
