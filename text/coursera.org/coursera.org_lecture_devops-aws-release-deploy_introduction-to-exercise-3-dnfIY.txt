These services simplify provisioning and managing infrastructure, deploying application code, automating software release processes, and monitoring your application and infrastructure performance. 

The third course in the series explains how to improve the deployment process with DevOps methodology, and also some tools that might make deployments easier, such as Infrastructure as Code, or IaC, and AWS CodeDeploy.

The course begins with reviewing topics covered in the first course of the DevOps on AWS series. You will learn about the differences between continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. In Exercises 1 and 2, you will set up AWS CodeDeploy and make revisions that will then be deployed. If you use AWS Lambda, you will explore ways to address additional considerations when you deploy updates to your Lambda functions.

Next, you will explore how infrastructure as code (IaC) helps organizations achieve automation, and which AWS solutions provide a DevOps-focused way of creating and maintaining infrastructure. In Exercise 3, you will be provided with an AWS CloudFormation template that will set up backend services, such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodeBuild. You will then upload new revisions to the pipeline.View SyllabusSkills You'll Learnaws, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, DevopsReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarHalf-Filled Star4.7 (68 ratings)5 stars76.47%4 stars22.05%2 stars1.47%JMApr 23, 2022Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarGood information with even greater examples, good documentation links to go on.Helpful?AWAug 8, 2022Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarI'm so hooked on this training directly from AWS professionalsHelpful?From the lessonWeek 2This week, you will explore how infrastructure as code (IaC) helps organizations achieve automation, and which AWS solutions provide a DevOps-focused way of creating and maintaining infrastructure.

This is where we put all the pieces  of what we learned together.  If you took the first class in the series,  you'll already be familiar with CodeCommit,  CodeBuild, and CodePipeline, and in this course,  you spent time learning about CodeDeploy and CloudFormation.  So, if we're using all of these services,  what could this lab possibly be about?  Well, you might have already guessed it.  You'll be automating the creation  of an entire CI/CD pipeline.  Here's how this will work.  I'll provide you the template that I showed  in the Automation of a Pipeline video.  You'll upload this template to CloudFormation,  and it will provision every piece of your pipeline,  including CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.  It will also kickstart your pipeline initially.  Take a look at the template and try to understand  each resource that gets created.  You can also see some of the CloudFormation features  that Raf mentioned earlier, such as the Parameters section.  For example, one of the parameters is an AMI ID  for the EC2 instance.  Instead of you specifying an Amazon Machine Image,  or AMI ID, the template grabs the latest AMI ID  from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store,  so you don't have to worry about choosing the wrong AMI.  After you provision the template,  you'll look at the pipeline that CodePipeline created  and check the output of the pipeline,  which is the application on your EC2 instance,  in this case, a website that shows a blog.  The other output of the pipeline is your acceptance test.  We've populated the CodeCommit repository  with a buildspec that shows the acceptance tests  we'll be performing on this application.  I'll display that same file on screen.  As you can see, we're getting the IP address of the server,  using cURL to get data from that IP address,  and the result we should get is the index.html page,  when we go to look at the output of this test.  That'll tell us that the website is reachable.  From there, you'll make a change to the index.html file  in the repository, which will kick off  the pipeline once again.  You'll then check the results of that pipeline by verifying  the code on your instance was changed.  Once again, feel free to post in the forums  if you run into any issues.  All right, let's get started with Exercise 3.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
