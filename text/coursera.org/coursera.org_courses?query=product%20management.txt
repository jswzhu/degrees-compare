Like project planning in other fields, the effective use of these techniques is important to ensuring that products are delivered on time and within their budget. However, product management is being transformed by the ability to access unprecedented amounts of marketing and consumer data, as well as the emergence of the market for digital products like apps which have a much more complex product lifecycle. Thus, expertise in modern product management methods is critically important. Whether youâre developing physical or software products, a familiarity with digital marketing analytics, user testing, and other customer research techniques provide invaluable insights on product/market fit to guide the development and marketing process. In industries like tech that prize innovation and speed, new frameworks like design thinking, Agile, and Scrum are popular ways to structure product development teams and processes to rapidly ideate, iterate, and bring new digital products to market. Regardless of the product youâre developing and your preferred methodology, the work of a product manager is still fundamentally about managing teams and ensuring they work together effectively. So, while modern product management techniques are increasingly important for meeting the needs of todayâs marketplace, interpersonal âsoft skillsâ will always be essential tools for professionals in this field.âChevron RightWhat careers can I pursue with a background in product management?âSkilled product managers are essential to the success of any company creating new products to sell, including any type of physical product ranging from new toys to manufacturing equipment to consumer electronics. While every physical product category has its own specific production and marketing requirements, there are also many shared similarities for product management processes that can allow professionals in this field to pursue careers across different industries. In contrast, product managers need more specialized expertise to work in tech, where a familiarity with specific software development and product management methodologies is a prerequisite for many companies. Product managers are also greatly elevated in importance in tech, to the point where McKinsey has called them âmini-CEOsâ - and noted an emerging trend of product management âemerging as a new training ground for future tech CEOs.ââChevron RightCan I learn product management through online courses available on Coursera?âYes, Coursera has a wide range of courses available in business as well as computer science topics - including product management, which often sits at the intersection of these two fields. You can learn about traditional product management techniques as well as specialized digital product methodologies from top-ranked institutions like the University of Virginia, HEC Paris, and the University of Alberta, or leading companies like Atlassian. Learning online also lets you to pursue your product management education on a flexible schedule, allowing you to build valuable new skills while continuing to work at your current job - or working on your latest entrepreneurial venture.âChevron RightWhat skills or experience do I need to already have, before starting to learn product management?âBefore you start to learn product management, itâs helpful to have a background or experience in strategic thinking, communication, research, technology, project management, presentation, and financial or analytical practices. Getting good at these skills will help you if you choose to work in this field. Working in product management generally means you are seeking ways to improve your product, whether itâs a software product or a box of cereal. Using your leadership skills, you could show a strategic vision thatâs positive for your companyâs product. Your skills in strategy, marketing, sales, engineering, and administrative work could also be beneficial to learning and working in product management.âChevron RightWhat kinds of people are best suited for roles in product management?âThe kinds of people who are best suited for roles in product management are professionals who have a strategic or analytical background, can communicate ideas well, have knowledge of the product technology, and are able to persuade investors or executives on the merit of the productâs benefits. Working as a software developer, product associate, or junior marketing exec could possibly lead to moving into an eventual product management role. This person would also have to be qualified for the role. That would mean that the person should show capabilities in strategy, planning, and leadership, while also having the right temperament and qualifications for the role.âChevron RightHow do I know if learning product management is right for me?âIf you're a person who loves to strategize and plan how a product works, understand what its benefits are, and show how it can potentially improve oneâs life, you may be a good fit for a role in product management. It takes a special personality to meet those requirements. If you can speak with knowledge and enthusiasm about a product to tech developers, salespeople, and senior executives, your personality may be right for this type of job. Being a product manager is currently a high-demand job, as many companies need people like this who can work equally with a variety of teams.âThis FAQ content has been made available for informational purposes only.
