Sit in on a Degree CourseIf you would like to get an idea of how the courses are structured in the degree program, or, if you want to get a head start on learning the material for when you start the degree, you can take a specialization or an open content course. Although they do not convey course credit, you will be able to familiarize yourself with the course material before starting the class.SpecializationsCloud Computing SpecializationData Mining SpecializationDeep Learning for Healthcare Specialization Hands-on Internet of Things SpecializationCoursesCloud Computing Concepts, Part 1Data VisualizationAlso, if you do not have graded and transcripted prerequisite CS coursework in the areas of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming, but have at least a 3.2 GPA and 4-5 years of relevant CS experience, check out our Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization. This series of courses is designed to help you prepare for the Data Structures Proficiency Exam, which can strengthen your application for admission. Admission preference is still given to those who have prerequisite coursework on their transcript.CurriculumIn this degree program, you can pursue a Master of Computer Science or specialize in data science through the Master of Computer Science in Data Science track. Interested in how assignments are designed for the online MCS? Find out how.Curriculum for both tracks are outlined below: Master of Computer ScienceBuild expertise and career skills in the most important computer science topics.  Courses and projects cover subjects like:Architecture, Compilers, and Parallel ComputingLearn parallel programming and how to achieve peak performance from multi-core CPU and many-core GPU architectures. Master languages, compilers, and libraries that are suited for various parallel applications and platforms.Artificial Intelligence and Machine LearningBuild your knowledge of the fundamental statistical models and numerical optimizations of machine learning, including deep learning, with applications in computer vision, natural language processing and intelligent user interaction.Database and Information SystemsLearn the basics of database systems as well as data mining methods for extracting insight from structured datasets (e.g. for a sales recommendation system) as well as unstructured data (e.g. from natural language text).Formal Methods, Programming Languages, and Software EngineeringDiscover the fundamentals of software engineering, including function-based and object-oriented methods for analysis and design. Learn to manage a large software project from specification through implementation, testing, and maintenance. Youâll also learn to manage large enterprise-level codebases.Graphics, Visualization, and Interactive ComputingLearn the fundamentals of interactive computing that promote synergy between the computer and its user. The Data Visualization course, for example, shows how to present and manipulate data to communicate understanding and insight to the public.Systems and NetworkingLearn how to network computers into distributed systems and build a cloud computing platform or an Internet of Things. Understand how to create applications that utilize cloud resources with programming projects that utilize Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.Scientific ComputingDiscover the fundamentals of numerical analysis, and how itâs applied to scientific and engineering simulations, with applications ranging from creating video game worlds to virtual medicine.When you graduate, youâll be able to:Apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory to real-word problemsAnalyze a problem and identify the computing requirements appropriate to its solutionDesign, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or programApply design and development principles to construct software systems of varying complexityMaster of Computer Science in Data Science TrackEarn your Masterâs, learn from pioneering Illinois faculty, and gain the data science skills that are transforming business and society. Illinois Computer Science offers a specialized track that includes both MCS degree requirements and data science-focused coursework.  This degree is right for anyone who not only wants to learn to extract knowledge and insights from massive data sets, but also wants full command of the computational infrastructure to do so. The Master of Computer Science in Data Science (MCS-DS) leads the MCS degree through a focus on core competencies in machine learning, data mining, data visualization, and cloud computing, It also includes interdisciplinary data science courses, offered in cooperation with the Department of Statistics and the School of Information Science.If you select the Data Science track, your courses and projects will focus on:Machine LearningCoursework focusing on tool-oriented and problem-directed approaches to machine learning with applications in computer vision, natural language processing, geopositioning, and voice & music.Data VisualizationCoursework designed to show you how to create effective and understandable data presentations. Learn database visualization tools like Tableau. Use D3.js to develop reactive web pages for narrative data storytelling.Data MiningThis course shows you how to discover patterns in structured data. Youâll also learn to retrieve information from unstructured data sources, such as natural language text.Cloud ComputingCoursework on the cloud computing technology, infrastructure and application development that is essential for supporting the discovery and extraction of knowledge from big data.When you graduate, youâll be able to:Utilize cloud computing to scale up analysis and processing of  big dataVisually and computationally analyze available data to inform critical decisionsStudy data scientifically, and use it to form, prove and defend hypothesesProgram effectively, using the right tools for the jobCurriculum and Graduation RequirementsBreadth CourseworkMaster of Computer Science (MCS)Master of Computer Science in Data Science (MCS-DS)Must complete four courses (16 credit hours) each from a different area, from the following core areas with a grade of B- or higher.Must complete one course each (with a grade of B- or higher) from the four different areas of machine learning, data mining, data visualization and cloud computing.Artificial Intelligence: CS 441 Applied Machine Learning, CS 445 Computational Photography, CS 447 Natural Language Processing, CS 598 Deep Learning for HealthcareMachine Learning: CS 441 Applied Machine Learning, CS 445 Computational Photography, CS 447 Natural Language Processing, CS 598 Deep Learning for HealthcareDatabase and Information Systems: CS 410 Text Information Systems, CS 411 Database Systems, CS 412 Introduction to Data MiningData Mining: CS 410 Text Information Systems, CS 411 Database Systems, CS 412 Introduction to Data MiningGraphics/HCI: 	CS 418 Interactive Computer Graphics, CS 445 Computational Photography, CS 416 Data Visualization, CS 519 Scientific VisualizationData Visualization: CS 416 Data Visualization, CS 519 Scientific VisualizationParallel Computing: CS 484 Parallel ProgrammingCloud Computing: CS 425 Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts), CS 435 Cloud Networking, CS 437 Internet of Things, CS 498 Cloud Computing ApplicationsProgramming Languages & Software Engineering: CS 421 Programming Languages and Compilers, CS 427 Software Engineering IâScientific Computing: CS 450 Numerical AnalysisâSecurity and Privacy: CS 463 Computer Security IIâSystems and Networking: CS 425 Distributed Systems (Cloud Computing Concepts), CS 435 Cloud Networking, CS 437 Internet of Things, CS 498 Cloud Computing ApplicationsâAdvanced CourseworkFor MCS and MCS-DS:
