To begin, enroll in the Specialization directly, or review its courses and choose the one you'd like to start with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of a Specialization, youâre automatically subscribed to the full Specialization. Itâs okay to complete just one course â you can pause your learning or end your subscription at any time. Visit your learner dashboard to track your course enrollments and your progress.Hands-on ProjectEvery Specialization includes a hands-on project. You'll need to successfully finish the project(s) to complete the Specialization and earn your certificate. If the Specialization includes a separate course for the hands-on project, you'll need to finish each of the other courses before you can start it.Earn a CertificateWhen you finish every course and complete the hands-on project, you'll earn a Certificate that you can share with prospective employers and your professional network.There are 3 Courses in this SpecializationCourse1Course  1Introduction to Probability and Data with RFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarHalf Faded Star4.7stars5,375 ratingsThis course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.Course2Course  2Inferential StatisticsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Star4.8stars2,525 ratingsThis course covers commonly used statistical inference methods for numerical and categorical data. You will learn how to set up and perform hypothesis tests, interpret p-values, and report the results of your analysis in a way that is interpretable for clients or the public. Using numerous data examples, you will learn to report estimates of quantities in a way that expresses the uncertainty of the quantity of interest. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The course introduces practical tools for performing data analysis and explores the fundamental concepts necessary to interpret and report results for both categorical and numerical dataCourse3Course  3Linear Regression and Modeling Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Star4.8stars1,634 ratingsThis course introduces simple and multiple linear regression models. These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio.InstructorMine Ãetinkaya-RundelAssociate Professor of the PracticeDepartment of Statistical Science 354,730 Learners 7 CoursesOffered byDuke UniversityDuke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge.

Do I need to attend any classes in person?This course is completely online, so thereâs no need to show up to a classroom in person. You can access your lectures, readings and assignments anytime and anywhere via the web or your mobile device.What background knowledge is necessary?Basic math, no programming experience required. A genuine interest in data analysis is a plus! In the later courses in the Specialization, we assume knowledge and skills equivalent to those which would have been gained in the prior courses (for example: if you decide to take course four, Bayesian Statistics, without taking the prior three courses we assume you have knowledge of frequentist statistics and R equivalent to what is taught in the first three courses). Do I need to take the courses in a specific order?Yes.Will I earn university credit for completing the Specialization? Coursera courses and  certificates don't carry university credit, though some universities may  choose to accept Specialization Certificates for credit. Check with  your institution to learn more.  What if I already have a certificate from Data Analysis and Statistical Inference?In this specialization, R is a requirement, and the labs have been enhanced and revised from the previous course. Success in the fourth course and the capstone project will depend heavily on successfully completing the first three courses in this specialization. Therefore, we require all students complete all courses to obtain the certificate.  Do I need specific software?Yes. You will need R and RStudio. Both are free and publicly available. You will need administrator access to your computer to install this software. More questions?
