This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

DevOps process can be visualized as an infinite loop, comprising these steps: plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor. Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and communicate to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality. This course in the DevOps on AWS specialization focuses on code, build and test parts of the workflow. We will discuss topics such as source control, best practices for Continuous Integration, and how to use the right tools to measure code quality, by identifying workflow steps that could be automated.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnDevops, Test Automation, AWS cloudReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarHalf-Filled Star4.6 (139 ratings)5 stars72.66%4 stars19.42%3 stars7.19%1 star0.71%BMJan 22, 2023Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarIt is a really good course I have learned about aws cloud9, code build. code commit, and also aws SAMHelpful?MUNov 5, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarExcellent Course but much better if the instructor speak slowly and show the labs with details.Helpful?From the lessonWeek 2In the second week, you will discover why itâs important for teams to incorporate testing into the software development lifecycle at different stages of the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. You will get hands-on with AWS solutions by performing various application tests with AWS CodeBuild, automate your release process with AWS CodePipeline, and automate code deployments with AWS CodeDeploy.The Test7:55Exercise 2 Introduction1:33Automate Testing8:22Exercise 3 Introduction0:59Taught ByRafael LopesPrincipal Cloud TechnologistRussell SayersSenior Cloud TechnologistAlana LaytonTechnical Curriculum DeveloperTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Alana] Hello all, it's time for our next exercise.  Currently, we have a build in our local environment.  Now, it's time to run exactly  the same build inside of CodeBuild.  We'll create a buildspec file  that contains the same tests we are performing  in the local build,  linting with Pylint, and unit tests with pytest.  We'll then commit the buildspec file  to the CodeCommit repository.  With this in place,  we can configure a CodeBuild build project.  The CodeBuild build project  needs to know where the source code is,  in this case, your CodeCommit repository,  and the environment where your build will run.  For this, we will use the Ubuntu image  managed by CodeBuild.  We won't configure an artifact  for this project, as we are just running tests.  We'll simply start a build,  and see the output from build logging as it happens.  When the build completes,  we can see the reports that are generated  from the output for unit test and code coverage.  So, let's get started with Exercise 3.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
