These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio....

I loved the final project which actually helped me to apply everything that I learnt during the 4 week period and hence cleared so many doubts I had in mind.

In general the course is amazing, very well explained, i learned a lot.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Duane Sâ¢Mar 30, 2017This course provides a very good introduction to basic linear regression, including simple multiple linear regression, model building and interpretation, model diagnostics, and application in R.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Erik Bâ¢Feb 26, 2017Good, but a little "smaller" than the Inferential statistics course (which is very complete). I would have liked to also learn Logistics regression, which I now have to learn elsewhere.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Allah D Nâ¢Dec 12, 2018Files for this course were broken and I faced a lot of trouble to find good one. This course may be made more comprehensive and not assuming that reader have also understanding.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Roel Mâ¢Dec 18, 2020A nice experience, clear explanations, lots of exercises that are really important. The project also allowed one to reflect carefully on how to use R to carry out the analysis. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Charles Gâ¢Jan 20, 2018Good but I felt some gaps in the material made it difficult to learn.  Also, the quiz questions are focused on attention to detail "gotcha" questions.  This can be frustrating. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Aydar Aâ¢Dec 20, 2017Nice course. The downside is that it only explains interpretation of linear regression, but not enough details about how linear regression is performed from math point of view.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Jessye Mâ¢Jan 13, 2017This course was good. However, compared to the other courses in the specialisation had less content.

But still learn a lot from the conception of linear regression!This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy christian aâ¢Apr 25, 2018Really good course as the previous ones in this specialization.

Wish it was longer and more mathematical, but there are other courses on Coursera for that.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Tony Gâ¢Jan 29, 2017Good overview of regression modeling.  Would have liked to see more on logistic regression.  But that's ok, can read it on my own.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Scott Tâ¢Aug 9, 2016Great course. I only wish there was more time spent on dealing with more complex situations such as overfitting.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Shivani Jâ¢Apr 5, 2020I liked the course.

Quite systematic and easy to understand.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Natalie Râ¢Jun 3, 2019Clearly presented.  R instruction is pretty minimal, so there is a lot of trial and error and googling.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Guillermo U O Gâ¢May 12, 2019I liked, but I guess it could improve little by including more topics in linear regression analysis.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy marvin mâ¢Nov 6, 2020The Lab could be better if there was a video that goes with it. But overall I love this course.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Jian Sâ¢Dec 12, 2016I learnt quite a bit. One of the most useful courses!
