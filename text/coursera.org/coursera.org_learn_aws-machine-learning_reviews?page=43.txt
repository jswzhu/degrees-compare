It can be divided in to several short videos. Seeing a long video is creating a boredom. Otherwise it is a very nice course.Helpful?ANApr 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course materials and lecture delivery was just one of a kind,I have learnt a complete skill on Machine Learning and its Algorithms.I hope this will lead me towards a next level of Data science.Helpful?See all 5 star reviewsFilter by:All LearnersChevron DownAll StarsChevron DownSort by:  Most HelpfulChevron Down1051 - 1075 of 1,512 Reviews for Getting Started with AWS Machine LearningFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Santhosh K Kâ¢May 15, 2020hiThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Dr M Kâ¢May 2, 2020okThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy VINOD P W â¢Jun 30, 20215This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Pawan K Gâ¢Jun 17, 2021This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Devidas Bâ¢Jun 13, 2021This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy PULAK Sâ¢May 31, 20211This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Sagar Câ¢Jun 12, 2020.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Seon W Lâ¢Dec 3, 2019.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Pooja Aâ¢Apr 29, 2020For the ones who just know the basics of machine learning can opt for this course and explore the services provided by aws from building, training, and deploying models or use them in just one click. The sagemaker examples that are shown in week-5 are useful for hands-on experience. If you are a student then you can create an aws educator account and perform them else you have to pay for these services in order to do the same. But either way, without hands-on experience doing the course, is of no use so even if it costs you a few dollars you should do it.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Jim Aâ¢Jul 8, 2020This course was really helpful to understand the Machine Learning concepts with Amazon AWS. It cover almost all the important basics concepts in Machine Learning. Lecture are very good, especially the hands on section demos included in the lectures give a surface knowledge about how to deploy the program into a real time Machine order Product. In short this lecture series is very interesting for beginners. Hoping more courses in this Subject in future. Thank you Amazon Team for this very useful platform.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Srinu Lâ¢Apr 19, 2020Overall it feels like a pretty good overview for people who have some experience in Machine Learning but are trying to perform some more complex tasks. I will say that the later weeks were much more interesting than the first, but that is probably because I was already aware of a lot of the first week's material. It would be nice if there were some assignments in this course so that we could attempt some of the things we see in the lectures. The quizzes are not comprehensive enough.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Vikash Kâ¢Jul 31, 2020This course really helps in understanding the way we can work on AWS cloud and using its various services to train the machine learning models. AWS provides a one stop solution for everything right from storing the huge data to doing feature engineering on it and hypertuning the parameters. This course  clearly gives us an insight into how AWS reduces the burden of integrating a number of tools and resources to train the model for our use.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Shivam Kâ¢May 31, 2020The course gives a good overview of machine learning in first couple of weeks then dives into the tools provided by Amazon to build efficient and cost-effective models. Models can be built using their templates or from scratch. Overall Amazon services seem to be good to provide people with lesser experience in Algorithms and functioning of models, to built a solution for their business problems.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Angel A R Vâ¢Jun 18, 2020Just an excellent guide and really eye-opening about all the opportunities there are for ML in AWS. I just wish sometimes they'd talk more about actually how to use or how the tools work than focusing too much on selling it to us. But is great to find out and to discover so many opportunities and to get to learn some crucial stuff like the pipeline and how to integrate the solutions.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Vitor R Dâ¢May 26, 2020As the name says, the course is really good for people that have interest on using AWS tools. But otherwise, if you are someone like me that was expecting to learn more about machine learning as a general topic it might not be the best choice. But since on the description it states that the course is to learn about this tool, it might be useful for most people.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy amit mâ¢Apr 11, 2020Basic course to understand what type of Product Amazon provides for ML training, deploying the model and made the prediction. one main thing that was missing from the course was the LAB since practical is much more important than theory.Most of the time in the course they just talk about their own services instead of how to do that or this.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Shailesh Tâ¢Jul 28, 2021This was an exhaustive course for someone looking to understand how AI & ML works. Amazon has exposed all the platforms created to help developers and all the computing power that can be utilized for large scale projects for ML. The course detailed many aspects of machine learning. Truly a great course for any beginner to explore ML.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy VinÃ­cius A R Lâ¢Dec 19, 2021Really helpful content overall. However, it is a compilation of videos so it does not feel as smooth as a well thought course in terms of structure and flow. There is some redundancy that could be eliminated to make the course shorter. Also, the quizzes are too shallow, most of them with only two questions, thus not that productive.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Sourav Sâ¢Jul 18, 2021Lectures were pretty nice and the instructors also taught the concepts properly. It would be even better if some videos were also made on how to actually write the code to deploy ML algorithms; explaining the syntax, the various functions, the functions of several imprtant keywords and so on..This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy SURAJIT Dâ¢May 24, 2020Thanks Amazon Web Service, and Coursera. AWS machine learning tools make things easy for developers, not only developers but it's also helpful non-tech persons. And this course describe those briefly. Video content, teaching style, interact session, quiz etc make the journey very interesting.   This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Kutbuddin Lâ¢May 12, 2020Provides an overview of how to get started with ML on AWS platform. Gives a glimpse of all the various tools available on AWS to make model building, training, tuning and deployment a hassle free process. Would recommend this course to anyone who is starting out on the AWS learning journey.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Vipul Sâ¢Mar 29, 2020Found this course to be very helpful to get foundations strong and to get an introduction to the phenomenal field of Machine Learning. But I would seriously not recommend this course to experts in the field of machine learning because no hands-on experience could be gained from this course. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Hakim Lâ¢Sep 26, 2019Nice compilation of AWS ML technologies. It was nice to see how things are done in practice in AWS platform even if you're not a SW developer. The course reminded me of a presales courses of major SW vendors. Highly recommended for persons with no AWS background, but basic knowledge of ML.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Rajan Mâ¢Aug 11, 2020Getting started with the AWS Machine learning course is very informative. You'll get a basic idea about what is AI, ML, and DL.Giving 4 rating cause of this is the only free course available in this series. You can add more free courses in the AWS course series having basic concepts.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Saleh Aâ¢Dec 5, 2019Good course that covers the basics of using ML and DL within the AWS environment. While many of the presenters were well focused and articulated, others were difficult to understand and their thoughts were not well collected. Overall, a great course and fantastic introduction to AWS.This is helpful Chevron Left 1 ... 38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47 ... 61 Chevron Right
