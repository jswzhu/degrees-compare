You will learn how to prepare for the exam by exploring the examâs topic areas and how they map to SysOps Administration on AWS. You will review sample certification questions in each domain, practice skills with hands-on exercises, test your knowledge with practice question sets, and learn strategies for identifying incorrect responses by interpreting the concepts that are being tested in the exam. At the end of this course you will have all the knowledge and tools to help you identity your strengths and weaknesses in each certification domain areas that are being tested on the certification exam.

The AWS Certified SysOps Administrator â Associate (SOA-C02) exam is intended for system
administrators in a cloud operations role. The exam validates a candidateâs ability to deploy, manage, and
operate workloads on AWS and their ability to complete the following tasks: Support and maintain AWS workloads according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework, perform operations by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, implement security controls to meet compliance requirements, monitor, log, and troubleshoot systems, apply networking concepts (for example, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls), implement architectural requirements (for example, high availability, performance, capacity), perform business continuity and disaster recovery procedures and identify, classify, and remediate incidentsView SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCloud Computing Security, Software Deployment, AWS cloudFrom the lessonWeek 3Welcome to Week 3! This week, you will get an overview of relevant concepts and services for Reliability and Business Continuity (Domain 2) and Networking and Content Delivery (Domain 5) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in these areas. For Domain 2, the question walkthroughs focus on implementing high availability, implementing scalability, and implementing backup and restore policies. Question walkthroughs for Domain 5 address implementing networking, working with Domain Name System (DNS) services and content delivery, and troubleshooting network issues. An optional exercise for Domain 5 gives you an opportunity to practice configuring an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket through AWS CloudFormation. This exercise has an accompanying video walkthrough that shows one possible solution for completing the exercise.Introduction to Reliability and Business Continuity5:38Question Walkthrough: Implement High Availability3:27Understanding Reliability and Business Continuity2:55Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Blaine] Welcome back.  We want to look deeper into a question  in the Reliability and Business Continuity domain.  So, let's pick one from subdomain 2.2:  Implement high availability  and resilient environments.  Reminder, this question is not from the actual exam,  but it is the same structure  and difficulty of one you might find there.  Ready? Here's the stem.  After implementing a multi-Region AWS deployment  for all production infrastructure,  what Amazon Route 53 feature  would minimize response time for users?  Breaking down this question is not that difficult,  as there's not a lot of moving parts here.  Let's see, multi-Region deployment,  Amazon Route 53,  and the value is minimizing response times.  This is straightforward knowledge check  of how well you understand the options in Route 53  when it comes to implementing routing policies.  Four responses:  A. Hosted zones for specific Regions.  B. Health checks with DNS failover.  C. Geolocation routing.  D. Latency-based routing.  Which one do you believe is the correct answer, the key?  Well, before I confirm which one is right,  let's eliminate some that are wrong.  Starting with response B,  health checks with DNS failover.  And let me begin by saying  I love health checks and DNS failover.  This is totally a good thing  when designing resilient architectures,  but the question is about normal operations,  not disaster planning.  That feature does not do anything  to improve response times for regular ops.  B is incorrect.  A. Hosted zones for specific Regions.  Yeah, that's not really a thing.  All records go into a global hosted zone.  It's not Region-specific.  So, A is incorrect.  That leaves us C and D.  Geolocation routing seems attractive,  but this makes too many assumptions about the fastest path.  And sometimes, a faster connection  may exist in an entirely different country,  just due to the unpredictable topologies  of the internet itself.  Geolocation is useful for compliance management,  such as which countries are going to see which  international-sporting-event-that-  my-lawyers-won't-let-me-mention-by-name  broadcast feeds.  But it is not normally the best way  to minimize response times  C: incorrect  Latency-based routing was specifically built  to minimize response times,  and send users to the closest Region  based on latency, not physical proximity  D is correct.  There it is A, B, and C are all distractors,  plausible and yet wrong,  while D is the key for this question.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
