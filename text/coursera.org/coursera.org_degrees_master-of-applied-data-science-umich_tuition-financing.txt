TuitionTuition for the School of Information Master of Applied Data Science online degree program reflects the quality and value of a University of Michigan education.We offer competitive rates for both in-state and out-of-state students. U-M is partially state-funded so Michigan residents pay a lower rate.The total cost of the 34-credit degree program is approximately $34,759 (about $1,022 per credit hour) for in-state students and approximately $46,149 (about $1,357 per credit hour) for out-of-state students, based on this year's estimated rates before fees. Unlike most online degree programs, the Master of Applied Data Science offers partial scholarships in addition to other types of financial aid.*Please note: All final tuition rates (including annual increases) are approved by the University of Michigan Board of Regents every June, so these figures are solely for estimating purposes.Pay As You GoWe offer several payment options, and fortunately you wonât be billed upfront for the whole degree. You may pay per term for all the classes you take that term, opt into a monthly payment plan, or pay each time you register for a course. If something comes up due to work, family, or other life commitments, and you need to take one or more months (sessions) or even an entire term off, you wonât be charged.Financial AidUnlike most online degree programs, the Master of Applied Data Science offers the opportunity for limited scholarships in addition to other types of financial aid. The information you provide on your application will be used to help determine eligibility for those scholarships. We expect more than half of our online students to receive some financial support.Financial ResourcesTo learn more about financing your degree visit the Degrees Financial Resources Hub.
