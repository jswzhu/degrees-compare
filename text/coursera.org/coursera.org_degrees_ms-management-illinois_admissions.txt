Who should pursue an MSM?The iMSM is designed for learners ready to add business to their skill set. The program is ideal for those who have already begun their careers and seek to add a business education through a part-time program, or for those who would ultimately like to pursue an MBA, but donât currently possess the work experience needed for admission. Through their iMSM coursework, learners can lay the foundation for future enrollment in an MBA program.Once youâve completed your degree, youâll be eligible to fully stack your Masterâs in Management into the iMBA program from Gies College of Business. This means if you choose to continue on to your MBA â either immediately afterward or years down the road â youâll instantly be halfway done with your degree.
