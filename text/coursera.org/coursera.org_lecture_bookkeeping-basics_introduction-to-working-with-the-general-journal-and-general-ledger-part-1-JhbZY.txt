Soon you'll be creating  even more journal entries that show  all the transactions that took place over the past week,  month, or even the whole year.  Do you know how this can help  Lew get a handle on his finances?  This could impact his family for years to  come in a good way.  It's such a beautiful thing.  Okay, where were we? We're still  here in the accounting cycle.  You remember Lew's shoeboxes full of receipts,  we organized and added some to the general journal.  I know it pains me to even think about it too.  Now we need to move all those journal entries  into the general ledger.  It's like these gold-made jelly beans.  These jelly beans are all candy,  just like the journal entries are all transactions.  Now if we separate these jelly beans by color,  we've organized them into categories.  If we want the tangerine ones,  now we can get to them right away.  Like with journal entries,  we'll organize them on  the general ledger according to the accounts involved.  This way, Lew can get a better picture of his finances.  At the end of the day,  the journal is simply a list  of transactions organized chronologically.  What we want to do next is reorganize  all the journal entries and group like items together.  In bookkeeping lingo, this is  called posting to the ledger.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
