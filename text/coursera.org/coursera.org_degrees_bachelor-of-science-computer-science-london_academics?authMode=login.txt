CurriculumThe BSc Computer Science degrees, developed by the team at Goldsmiths, University of London, are designed to give you a strong foundation in Computer Science and specialised knowledge of topics such as Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and Web Development. The programme covers industry and academic case studies to help you apply studies in terms of real-world problems. Youâll develop and execute a series of projects throughout the programme to develop technical skills and hone problem solving abilities.The programmes are structured into three levels. The first level covering computer programming, with a special project on web applications. You will learn how computers work as well as the mathematics that underpin computer science. The second level deepens your programming skills and your understanding of how to develop substantial software projects. Youâll also begin to learn specialised topics such as Graphics Programming and Data Science. In the third level, youâll have the opportunity to study specialised modules depending on your specialist pathway and bring your knowledge and skills together with a final individual project â developing your own software. With a BSc Computer Science degree youâll be qualified to:Build and maintain reliable software to address  the sophisticated demands of today's marketDevelop innovative and creative approaches to problem solvingWork independently with confidenceCompete for roles at the cutting-edge of the tech sector, including application programmer, mobile app developer, web developer, video game developer, SFX and post-production, and systems analystTo gain a BSc in Computer Science, youâll need to complete modules worth 360 credits.
This includes: 8 compulsory modules at level 4, covering the fundamentals: how computers work, how to programme, and mathematics that underpin computer science.8 compulsory modules at level 5, covering programming skills needed for software projects and specialist topics such as Graphics Programming and Data Science.6 elective modules from level 6, then undertake a 30 credit project that combines your knowledge and skills to create a software system.Complete a Final project.All of the Level 4 and Level 5 modules are compulsory. There is a broad range of elective options at Level 6.Level 4 - compulsoryIntroduction to programming IIntroduction to programming IIComputational mathematicsDiscrete mathematicsHow computers workFundamentals of computer scienceWeb developmentAlgorithms and data structures ILevel 5 - compulsoryObject oriented programmingSoftware design and developmentDatabases, networks and the webAgile software projectsComputer securityGraphics programmingAlgorithms and data structures IIProgramming with dataLevel 6 - Choose 6 of the following modulesData scienceDatabases and advanced data techniquesMachine learning and neural networksArtificial intelligenceVirtual realityGames developmentAdvanced web developmentPhysical computing and the internet of things3D Graphics and animationMobile developmentInteraction designNatural language processingIntelligent signal processingMore information about each module here.You can choose to register on a specialist award to focus your studies on a particular area of Computer Science. The specialist awards are:BSc Computer Science (Machine Learning and AI)BSc Computer Science (Data Science)BSc Computer Science (Web and Mobile Development)BSc Computer Science (Physical Computing and the Internet of Things)BSc Computer Science (Games Development)BSc Computer Science (Virtual Reality)BSc Computer Science (User Experience)Try a CourseThe University of London offers a number of online taster courses and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), designed to introduce themes that are included in degree programmes. The University is running three open courses that explore topics covered in the BSc Computer Science degrees.Introduction to Computer Programming
This course provides the foundational skillset required to write computer programs. Youâll learn how to write interactive, graphical programs from an introductory level in a real programming language. The course uses the Javascript language and the p5.js.library.How Computers Work
This course is designed for people who use computers, smartphones and the internet regularly and want to understand more about how they work. It is for beginners in computer science and people  interested in a more formal study of computer science. This course covers fundamental concepts that can be applied to any software or computer system, and how to apply concepts to solve everyday problems.Mathematics for Computer Science
This course covers the mathematical foundations needed to work in computer science in any of its strands, from business to visual digital arts, music, games. At any stage of the problem solving and modelling stage you will need proper numerical and computational tools.  Learn binary and other number bases, tools to understand sequences of numbers, how to represent space numerical using coordinates, and study variations of quantities via functions and their graphs. Solve computing and everyday life problems using these tools, from sending secret messages to designing computer graphics.If you would like a certificate of completion, you will need to submit a full payment to Coursera.
 Programme LengthThe Bachelor of Science, via the Direct Entry Route, can be completed in three to six years, depending on module availability.Students entering via Performance Based Admissions will have a maximum of three years to complete the two modules required for admission to the full programme. The six year registration period will begin at the time of registration to the full BSc.This is a flexible programme, allowing students to study at their own pace (either part-time or full-time), adjusting the intensity of the learning to suit individual needs. There are 2 sessions in the academic year with modules starting in either October or AprilSample Schedule3 Years (28 hours per week)Autumn (October)4 modulesSpring (April)4 modulesAutumn (October)4 modulesSpring (April)4 modulesAutumn (October)4 modulesSpring (April)2 modules + Projectâ¢ Over a 22 week session, a 15 credit module will typically require 150 hours of notional study hours. Each module, excluding the final project, is organised into 10 topics, with approximately 10-12 hours of study required per topic. The remaining study time is intended for coursework and examination preparation. This will roughly equate to 7 hours of study per module per week.â¢ There are 2 sessions in the academic year with modules starting in either October or Aprilâ¢ Students complete the programme in 3-6 years FlexibilityFully online: The flexible degree programmes are designed to fit studentsâ personal schedules, allowing you to study online at your own pace.
