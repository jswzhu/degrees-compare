Maybe youâd talk to a customer somewhere in there and theyâd tell you what features they wanted. But companies that manage product that way are dying.Being a product person today is a new game, and product managers are at the center of it. Today, particularly if your product is mostly digital, you might update it several times a day. Massive troves of data are available for making decisions and, at the same time, deep insights into customer motivation and experience are more important than ever. The job of the modern product manager is to charter a direction and create a successful working environment for all the actors involved in product success.  Itâs not a simple job or an easy job, but it is a meaningful job where youâll be learning all the time. 

This course will help you along your learning journey and prepare you with the skills and perspective you need to:

Create the actionable focus to successfully manage your product (week 1)
Focus your work using modern product management methods (week 2)
Manage new products and explore new product ideas (week 3)
Manage and amplify existing products (week 4)

This course is ideal for current product or general  managers interested in today's modern product management methods.

Please note that there are new additions to this course and subtitles for these videos will soon be available.

But it doesn't have to be this way. Agile and design thinking offer a different--and effective--approach to product development, one that results in valuable solutions to meaningful problems. In this course, youâll learn how to determine what's valuable to a user early in the process--to frontload value--by focusing your team on testable narratives about the user and creating a strong shared perspective.

This is easier said than done, but most of todayâs high-functioning innovators have a strong culture of experimentation.In this course, youâll learn how to identify the right questions at the right time, and pair them with the right methods to do just enough testing to make sure you minimize waste and maximize the outcomes you create with your user.
