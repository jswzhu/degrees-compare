Monitoring and Operation are key aspects for both the release pipeline and production environments, because they provide instruments that help discover what's happening, as well as do modifications and enhancements on infrastructure that is currently running. 

This course teaches how to use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, as well as Amazon EventBridge and AWS Config for continuous compliance. It also covers Amazon CloudTrail and a little bit of Machine Learning for Monitoring operations!View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCI/CD, aws, DevopsReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarHalf-Filled Star4.6 (70 ratings)5 stars71.42%4 stars18.57%3 stars8.57%2 stars1.42%From the lessonWeek 2This week, you will start by learning about the importance of operation in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and discover how to detect unmanaged configuration changes to your cloud resources. Though this course focused on AWS solutions for DevOps operations and monitoring, you will also learn about third-party, open-source tooling that are well-known and widely used by the DevOps community. Lastly, you will get hands-on and run commands using AWS Systems Manager, and output logs to Amazon CloudWatch.Introduction to Week 2 - Operate1:47How to Prevent Hiccups at the End of the Infinite Loop4:06Detecting Unmanaged Configuration Changes to Your Cloud Resources3:28Taught ByRafael LopesPrincipal Cloud TechnologistAlana LaytonTechnical Curriculum DeveloperRussell SayersSenior Cloud TechnologistTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Raf] I hope you liked the content and the lab  we put together for you for the previous week.  Don't forget to use the discussion groups or forums  if you had any issue with the lab,  or if you want to ask something.  We will be constantly monitoring the discussion groups  and forums to interact with you.  In the second week of this course,  I will be covering aspects regarding the operational part  of your environments.  An important aspect of the DevOps workflow  is to know that a continuum must be made.  That's where the term continuous integration  and continuous delivery comes from.  A continuum means that the workflow acts  as an infinite loop.  And in order for that to smoothly succeed,  you must think about things that would allow the loop  to be completed.  Otherwise, it's not a loop, but a dead end.  What I mean here is that you need to think about things  that will not interrupt the DevOps workflow.  And AWS offers a suite of services  that you can use to facilitate that.  In this week of the course,  I will be talking about the AWS services  that will help you operationalize your infrastructure.  What I mean by operationalize  is having your infrastructure operating in a uniform  and compliant state.  For example,  there is a service called AWS Systems Manager  that helps a lot with that task,  and we will be covering some of the core aspects of it.  I will also be talking about CloudFormation best practices.  At the end of the week, you will do a hands-on exercise  using a feature of AWS Systems Manager  called Run Command to troubleshoot production issues.  Ready to start operationalizing everything?
