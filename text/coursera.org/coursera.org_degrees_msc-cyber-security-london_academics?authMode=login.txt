In this module, youâll develop a broad understanding of the cybercrime environment by combining economic, technical, political, legal, and psychological angles of cybercrime. Youâll consider the evolution and current forms of cybercrime, as well as the context of crimes, the motivations of actors, and the technical mechanisms and tools that are used. Additionally, youâll explore the challenges that these phenomena pose and the capabilities and limitations of law enforcement and investigations. Youâll develop an understanding of the cybercrime environment through real-world examples and case studies.Applied cryptography (CYM040)
In this module, youâll explore the role of cryptography in supporting security for everyday applications such as the internet, mobile phones, wireless networks, and cryptocurrency. Youâll develop an understanding of the functionality and purpose of the main cryptographic tools that we use today. Youâll also learn how to make decisions about which cryptographic tools to use in specific settings. Finally, youâll explore the wider infrastructure surrounding cryptography and how this impacts the overall security of systems that use cryptography.Network and infrastructure security (CYM050)
This module builds on the foundations of cyber security so you can develop your understanding of the key technologies that are used in computer networks and infrastructure. These include operational technologies and critical national infrastructure â protocols, computer networks, data centres, and operational technologies â that are critical to the success of organisations and services, from a local to an international scale.The module covers vulnerabilities and the exploits that target computer networks and systems, and the internet infrastructure. Youâll get an introduction to modeling, assessing, and testing networks and systems, and youâll explore key aspects of the topic through case studies.Computer systems security (CYM060)
In this module, youâll explore security mechanisms in modern computer systems. Youâll look at the core concepts â security policies, security models, subjects and objects, authorisation, and access rights â and gain an understanding of why operating systems and computer systems remain vulnerable to attack, and how they can be strengthened.
We will also discuss security issues for computer hardware and software, user authentication, access control models and policies, how authentication and access control are implemented in commercial products, virtualisation, containers, and cloud infrastructure. Youâll explore key aspects of this topic through case studies.Software and application security (CYM070)
In this module, youâll get an introduction to the principles around software and applications, including security and the issues of malicious software. Youâll study the techniques used for secure software development, the principles of secure programming, and the most common software vulnerabilities that can be introduced during software development. At the end of the module, youâll discuss the wider considerations and research direction for software and application security.
Youâll explore key aspects of software and application security through a number of topical case studies, such as the web and the cloud. This module complements the Computer Systems Security and Infrastructure Security modules.Security and behaviour change (CYM080)
Security is heavily dependent on humans and their actions. These actions can either strengthen or diminish security levels. In this module, youâll explore the relationships between security and human behaviour in multiple settings.
Youâll consider perceptions and practical implementations of security, on both an individual and a group/societal level. Youâll utilise concepts from behavioural economics, decision-making, and psychology, along with mechanisms to design and encourage changes in security behaviours. Finally, youâll examine the construct of a security culture and its relationships with norms, habits and awareness training.Information privacy (CYM090)
In this module, youâll learn about the challenges facing any organisation in managing data privacy. Youâll gain an understanding of the meaning of data privacy and will examine the serious legal constraints facing all organisations which make data privacy a key issue for cybersecurity risk management.
Youâll examine key governance matters, including privacy impact assessments. Youâll also consider the role of technology in supporting privacy, including de-identification techniques for datasets, homomorphic encryption, and other privacy enhancing technologies. Finally, youâll study a privacy case study, such as e-voting.Research methods for cyber security (CYM100)
