This course focuses on clinical trials, the value of applying discoveries to clinical practice, and best practices for conducting research. Youâll see examples of human subjects research through clinical trials that have been translated into practice and, later, into basic scientific discoveries. Youâll also discuss the role of the federal government in supporting and regulating translational research conducted on humans.This is the third course of five in the âTranslational Scienceâ series.Flexible deadlinesFlexible deadlinesReset deadlines in accordance to your schedule.Shareable CertificateShareable CertificateEarn a Certificate upon completion100% online100% onlineStart instantly and learn at your own schedule.SpecializationCourse 3 of 5 in theTranslational Science  SpecializationBeginner LevelBeginner LevelHours to completeApprox. 6 hours to completeAvailable languagesEnglishSubtitles: EnglishCould your company benefit from training employees on in-demand skills?Try Coursera for BusinessFlexible deadlinesFlexible deadlinesReset deadlines in accordance to your schedule.Shareable CertificateShareable CertificateEarn a Certificate upon completion100% online100% onlineStart instantly and learn at your own schedule.SpecializationCourse 3 of 5 in theTranslational Science  SpecializationBeginner LevelBeginner LevelHours to completeApprox. 6 hours to completeAvailable languagesEnglishSubtitles: EnglishCould your company benefit from training employees on in-demand skills?Try Coursera for BusinessInstructorVicki EllingrodDean of the College of PharmacyCollege of Pharmacy 959 Learners 5 CoursesOffered byUniversity of MichiganThe mission of the University of Michigan is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future.go to previous testimonialgo to next testimonial123See how employees at top companies are mastering in-demand skillsLearn more about Coursera for BusinessSyllabus - What you will learn from this courseWeek1Week  1Hours to complete3 hours to completeWeek 1Welcome to Week 1 of Translating Research to Patients.

As the translational research enterprise â both in the United States and internationally â continues to expand, there is a growing need to increase the number of people pursuing training in the fields of clinical research and translational science. This includes a continuing demand for a well-trained workforce of research investigators, clinician-scientists, and other research professionals.

In this online course series, you will learn about these in-demand fields with an introduction to the four phases of translational science and how they relate to both clinical and translational research. Specifically, youâll explore:

â What constitutes translational science research.

â The role of the federal government and industry in the support and regulation of this research.

â The need for core principles of conducting rigorous and responsible translational research.

â How to begin a career in translational research.

â Why addressing health disparities and inequities in translational research is important.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhen will I have access to the lectures and assignments?Access to lectures and assignments depends on your type of enrollment.
