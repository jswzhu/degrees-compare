MCS-DS Career OpportunitiesA 2016 McKinsey & Company study predicts that there will be a shortfall of nearly 250,000 data scientists by 2024, even after estimating a 7% per year increase in data science graduates. Business Insider cites being a data scientist as the highest paying job for college graduates at $95,000 per year. MCS Career OpportunitiesThe demand for computer science jobs is not limited to Silicon Valley â there are positions in nearly every major industry. PayScale indicates that the average salary of an MCS degree-holder is about $17,000 more than those who only hold a bachelorâs degree in computer science. And the projected 5-year growth for salaries ranges from 14 to 28%.
