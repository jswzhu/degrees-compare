You will learn how to prepare for the exam by exploring the examâs topic areas and how they map to SysOps Administration on AWS. You will review sample certification questions in each domain, practice skills with hands-on exercises, test your knowledge with practice question sets, and learn strategies for identifying incorrect responses by interpreting the concepts that are being tested in the exam. At the end of this course you will have all the knowledge and tools to help you identity your strengths and weaknesses in each certification domain areas that are being tested on the certification exam.

The AWS Certified SysOps Administrator â Associate (SOA-C02) exam is intended for system
administrators in a cloud operations role. The exam validates a candidateâs ability to deploy, manage, and
operate workloads on AWS and their ability to complete the following tasks: Support and maintain AWS workloads according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework, perform operations by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, implement security controls to meet compliance requirements, monitor, log, and troubleshoot systems, apply networking concepts (for example, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls), implement architectural requirements (for example, high availability, performance, capacity), perform business continuity and disaster recovery procedures and identify, classify, and remediate incidentsView SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCloud Computing Security, Software Deployment, AWS cloudFrom the lessonWeek 2Welcome to Week 2! This week, you will review relevant concepts and services for Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation (Domain 3) and Monitoring, Logging, and Remediation (Domain 1) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in these areas. Question walkthroughs for Domain 3 address the topics of provisioning and maintaining cloud resources, and automating manual or repeatable processes. For Domain 1, question walkthroughs cover using AWS monitoring and logging services, and remediating issues. In addition, this week features optional hands-on exercises for both domains so that you can practice your skills with creating a basic environment and automating with a monitoring solution. Accompanying video walkthroughs show one possible solution for addressing the requirements for each exercise.Introduction to Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation5:05Question Walkthrough: Provision and Maintain Cloud Resources6:45Lab Introduction: Creating a Basic Environment2:36Possible Lab Solution: Creating a Basic Environment8:05Understanding Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation3:11Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Seph] Hi, and welcome back.  I hope you were able to successfully work  through the requirements of this practice exercise.  Here, I'll show you one of the paths that I would take  to complete these requirements.  What I've already done was look at the requirements  and then mapped out what I needed to do  so I could approach this with some direction.  Because most of the building I need to do is with a VPC,  and because it needs to exist before I launch the instance,  that is where I'm starting.  In the us-east-2 Region, also called Ohio,  I will navigate to the VPC page.  I could use the VPC Wizard,  and in normal circumstances I would,  but to show you a bit more, I'll take the scenic route.  Clicking on Your VPCs in the navigation pane  will take me to my collection of VPCs.  From here, I can click Create VPC in the top right.  Making sure I match the requirements,  I'll call the VPC practice-vpc  and then set the IPv4 CIDR block  to 10.0.0.0/16  and click Create VPC.  Now that my VPC is successfully created,  I'll take care of the rest of the requirements for the VPC.  Going over to Subnets, I'll click Create subnet,  and here, I'll create my four subnets.  I'll make sure they're all in the newly created practice-vpc  and call my first one Public 1.  Because these requirements state that my subnets  be distributed across two Availability Zones,  and because using no preference  will not guarantee AZ distribution,  I'll directly select us-east-2a for this one.  I'll set my CIDR block  to 10.0.0.0/24  and leave everything else as is.  Because I can,  I'll just create all of the other subnets here as well.  That will include Private 1, Public 2, and Private 2.  Their process is the exact same,  so I won't talk through them.  Just keep in mind that you need to pay attention  to the IP ranges of your subnets,  as they won't allow overlap.  All right, now that I've clicked Create subnets,  and they've successfully created,  I'll move on with the other requirements.  I'll go to Internet Gateways,  click Create internet gateway,  name it practice-igw,  and click Create internet gateway.  With it created,  I'll click the helpful Attach to VPC in the upper right.  I could also do this through the Actions dropdown menu,  but this saves me a click.  I'll select my practice-vpc  and then click Attach internet gateway.  Now that the IGW is attached,  it's time for me to create the requested route table.  I'll click Route Tables, then Create route table,  name it practice-rtb,  make sure it's in my practice-vpc,  and click Create.  With that created and back on my Route Tables page,  I'll select the new route table, go into its routes,  click Edit routes, and then click Add route.  Here, I'll add the required IGW route  by using the all-other-traffic CIDR designation,  selecting the practice-igw,  then clicking Save routes.  Now, back on the Route Tables details page,  I'll click Subnet Associations,  then click Edit subnet associations,  and select the two public subnets  to have the IGW route associated.  After clicking Save,  my VPC-specific requirements are done.  To complete this practical exercise,  it's time for me to handle the Amazon EC2 components.  I'll navigate to EC2,  and because everything I need to do  can be handled through the instance launching,  I'll go ahead and click the Launch instance button.  I'll select the requirements-specified AMI,  keep the required instance type selected,  and then click to Configure instance details.  Here, I'll first make sure the instance is launched  in the appropriate VPC  and into the Public 1 subnet.  Because the requirements state  that it needs to have a public IP,  I'll enable Auto-assign Public IP.  I'll now click Next,  and then Next again to get me to the tagging options.  Because I'm required to give the instance a resource name,  I'll use the tags to do so.  I'll click Add Tag,  make the Key, Name  and the Value, new-instance, as specified.  Now I'll click Configure Security Group,  and here, I'll take care of the requirement  to create the security group.  I'll leave Create a new security group selected,  make its name practice-sg,  and I'll remove the SSH rule,  since there's no need to make an SSH connection.  Also, because the requirements do not dictate  I create any rules,  I can just leave it like it is and click Review and Launch.  I know everything is how I want,  so I can now just click Launch to move forward.  On the exam, make sure you double-check  to ensure you're not missing anything.  When asked about the key pairs,  remember that the requirements do not request  that you use or create instance keys,  so I'm going to select Proceed without a key pair,  select the acknowledgement, and then click Launch instances.  With that done, I've now met all of the requirements  and this practice exercise is done.  I've created a VPC with a configuration and components  that meet the requirements.  I've launched an instance with the required configuration,  location, and security group per the specifications.  Remember that if your path to completion  did not look exactly like mine, that's okay.  All you need to do is ensure that you met all requirements.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
