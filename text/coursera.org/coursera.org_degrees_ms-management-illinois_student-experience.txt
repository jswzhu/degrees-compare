Student ExperienceAs an iMSM student, youâll learn from and engage with senior faculty at Gies College of Business. The Gies Business faculty team has crafted a student experience that thoughtfully takes advantage of the iMSMâs online setting.Lectures and video material better suited for independent learning are delivered through asynchronous courses (Coursera MOOCs). This allows valuable discussion time in live class sessions, often used for lectures in traditional business programs, to be preserved for students to truly engage with senior-level faculty.Giesâ online classrooms are collaborative spaces that encourage side conversations â creative, innovative thinking â and strong relationships built between students and faculty alike. Youâll also get to know your classmates by working on team projects.What are students saying?Anne Murphy-Brown: "As a Gies iMSM student, I was able to immediately apply concepts from my very first class to my career. Throughout the Leadership and Teams course, I analyzed my own leadership skills and pivoted to a more collaborative style, using the tools that I learned in the course."Omeed Adham Sindy: "Be ready to experience different ideas and perspectives from some of the industry's leading experts. Gies College of Business promotes collaboration and creativity, and it provides learners with the necessary tools and resources to lead the world of tomorrow."Have questions?
