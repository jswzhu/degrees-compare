The World Economic Forum states the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) could create 58 million net new jobs in the next few years, yet itâs estimated that currently there are 300,000 AI engineers worldwide, but millions are needed. This means there is a unique and immediate opportunity for you to get started with learning the essential ML concepts that are used to build AI applications â no matter what your skill levels are. Learning the foundations of ML now, will help you keep pace with this growth, expand your skills and even help advance your career. 

This course will teach you how to get started with AWS Machine Learning. Key topics include: Machine Learning on AWS, Computer Vision on AWS, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) on AWS.

It can be divided in to several short videos. Seeing a long video is creating a boredom.

This course seems just like an extended advertisement for AWS. This course neither contains any practical exercise for students to try on AWS nor any strong technical details about ML. This is helpful (94)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Erik Lâ¢Oct 31, 2019DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE if you're not already a machine learning expert!This course only shows you how to use different Amazon Web Service applications. It will not teach you anything about the basics of machine learning. This is what I thought by the way...This is helpful (44)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Ben Râ¢Sep 28, 2019Very sloppy. Typos in the slides, cases of duplicate videos appearing in the same week, and quizzes where none of the answer choices are correct. I've come to expect better from Coursera. This was a huge disappointment.This is helpful (37)Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Shaikh M A â¢May 23, 2020This course is a compilation of unstructured content that has been taken from the actual AWS certification programs. Most of the videos have repetitive content. The initial week includes content regarding the theoretical aspect of machine learning, which in general is adequate. In week 2,3,4, Amazon advertises their services and persistently tell you that why even bother learning about machine learning. The last week has some videos that are very lengthy which jump from 10 to 100 in terms of theoretical and practical knowledge, thus making a huge gap in the learners learning. This course tends to fail in recognising their target audience. Other cons: IMO purchasing this course is of no use. The course, for the least, could have provided labs for specific modules to explore the platform and to better understand the concepts taught step by step. Moreover, I am extremely disappointed from Coursera for providing such courses. Courses as such, in my opinion, are becoming a new medium to advertise your brand instead of providing insightful knowledge.This is helpful (24)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy V.

The quizzes ask only one or two questions. The workload is not divided properly. Some weeks have hours long videos and some has a few minute ones. It seems like an intern has combined the videos from AWS library to generate some traffic on Coursera. There are only demos of the tool and no hands-on labs like the ones Google offers. You are much better off seeing the videos on AWS's portal.This is helpful (8)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Junze Wâ¢Jun 3, 2020This course is basically an AWS commercial.This is helpful (7)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Abhishek Nâ¢Apr 13, 2020The course materials and lecture delivery was just one of a kind,I have learnt a complete skill on Machine Learning and its Algorithms.I hope this will lead me towards a next level of Data science.This is helpful (6)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Vipul Zâ¢May 13, 2020Very good course to learn basics of Machine learning for beginners.

I enjoyed the course, but it will be more helpful if you could separate the courses and give those already into machine learning, more hands on to the AWS tools and remove the repetitiveness in the concept we already know. Coming from ML Course (Stanford) by Andrew Ng. Week 4 and 5 had a lot of useful concepts that we can use. Over-rally it was worth every pen.This is helpful (5)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Deleted Aâ¢May 16, 2020Is there a way to cancel?This is helpful (5)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Mark L Iâ¢Jul 12, 2020This is basically a course to show off Amazon's Machine Learning tools from Amazon Web Services.

Brainstorm and deploy an AI-powered feature/product for your business/project.Comments: Good overview of AWS products. ML pipeline and architecture shared is useful as a reference. This course should be much cheaper as it is a curated list of existing AWS training videos with no additional benefits like labs or coupons for hands-on learning.
