This week, you will review relevant concepts and services for Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation (Domain 3) and Monitoring, Logging, and Remediation (Domain 1) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in these areas. Question walkthroughs for Domain 3 address the topics of provisioning and maintaining cloud resources, and automating manual or repeatable processes. For Domain 1, question walkthroughs cover using AWS monitoring and logging services, and remediating issues. In addition, this week features optional hands-on exercises for both domains so that you can practice your skills with creating a basic environment and automating with a monitoring solution. Accompanying video walkthroughs show one possible solution for addressing the requirements for each exercise.Introduction to Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation5:05Question Walkthrough: Provision and Maintain Cloud Resources6:45Lab Introduction: Creating a Basic Environment2:36Possible Lab Solution: Creating a Basic Environment8:05Understanding Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation3:11Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Seph] As you hopefully know,  the Certification exam now has a practical component,  where you'll be given loose instructions,  and then be required to build a possible solution.  Many of these prompts will have multiple solutions,  but the goal will be to have all of the requirements met.  To assist in your preparation,  we've built some similar prompts for you to work through.  The way this will work is,  first, we'll present a challenge to you.  This will include the requirements  for you to build in the test environment.  Second, you'll be given the written prompt  with the additional necessary details,  and you'll get to work through it.  Third, we'll show you one of the possible solutions  for meeting the requirements.  Note that this is just one of the solutions  that meets the requirements,  but your path to a solution may be different.  It's more important to have all of the requirements met  than to match our methodology.  On the actual exam,  you'll only receive the written instructions,  and you'll be expected to complete it  as part of the timed exam,  but this will allow you to practice.  So, let's get to it.  For the first exercise,  you'll be building a basic environment.  This environment must meet these six requirements.  One, you must create an Amazon VPC that is highly available  and has four subnets.  Two, it should have an internet gateway that is attached.  Three, it needs route tables  that enable half of the subnets to be publicly accessible.  Four, you'll need to create a security group.  Five, you'll launch an Amazon EC2 instance  with a public IP address and public connectivity  in one of the public subnets.  And the sixth requirement is that the security group  needs to be attached to the newly launched EC2 instance.  It's important to note  that these are requirements, and not steps.  You should make sure you read through  all of the requirements to know what is needed,  and then come up with your plan to move forward.  Some of these will require definite ordering,  while others may be a little more flexible.  With your plan, moving forward will be easier  and waste less time when you're taking the actual exam.  Good luck, and I'll show you a possible solution  after you've had your chance to work through it yourself.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
