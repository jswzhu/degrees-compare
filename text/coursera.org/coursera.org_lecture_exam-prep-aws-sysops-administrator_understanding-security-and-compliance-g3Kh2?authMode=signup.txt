You will learn how to prepare for the exam by exploring the examâs topic areas and how they map to SysOps Administration on AWS. You will review sample certification questions in each domain, practice skills with hands-on exercises, test your knowledge with practice question sets, and learn strategies for identifying incorrect responses by interpreting the concepts that are being tested in the exam. At the end of this course you will have all the knowledge and tools to help you identity your strengths and weaknesses in each certification domain areas that are being tested on the certification exam.

The AWS Certified SysOps Administrator â Associate (SOA-C02) exam is intended for system
administrators in a cloud operations role. The exam validates a candidateâs ability to deploy, manage, and
operate workloads on AWS and their ability to complete the following tasks: Support and maintain AWS workloads according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework, perform operations by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, implement security controls to meet compliance requirements, monitor, log, and troubleshoot systems, apply networking concepts (for example, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls), implement architectural requirements (for example, high availability, performance, capacity), perform business continuity and disaster recovery procedures and identify, classify, and remediate incidentsView SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCloud Computing Security, Software Deployment, AWS cloudFrom the lessonWeek 4Welcome to Week 4! This week, you will review relevant concepts and services for on Security and Compliance (Domain 4) and Cost and Performance Optimization (Domain 6) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in these areas. The Domain 4 question walkthroughs cover data and infrastructure protection, and security and compliance policies. For Domain 6, the question walkthroughs focus on cost-optimization strategies and performance-optimization strategies. This week also includes a practice assessment that includes questions from all exam domains.Introduction to Security and Compliance5:14Question Walkthrough: Data and Infrastructure Protection9:17Understanding Security and Compliance4:36Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Seph] After looking at the exam content for the security  and compliance domain,  you can probably see that this topic is crucial  to your success, not only on the exam,  but also with your everyday use of AWS.  If you keep up with technology-related news,  it's difficult to go very long without hearing  about some security breach or vulnerability  found with some company or application.  Even past the threat of a security breach,  there is a peace of mind in knowing that you're planning  and building your environments  with security as a priority.  And security and compliance should be considered  for every step of the process.  When you or others in your organization  need to connect to AWS,  what's in place to make those connections secure?  Are you using multi-factor authentication?  Do you expect many to need direct console access?  If people do need console access,  have you looked into other ways to provide that access?  For connecting to AWS,  it goes past just a strong password policy.  You should be looking into ways  to provide access through roles and federation.  With just those few questions,  it is clear that a deep understanding of  AWS Identity and Access Management  is a cornerstone of your ability to build security  into your environments.  The way that your users, services, and tools  access and use AWS will be majorly controlled by IAM,  and a limited understanding of this area  will drastically hinder you.  It's the difference between being able to follow  the best practice of granting least-privileged access  and creating policies that are wide open,  enabling greater levels of user error,  as well as mistakes made due to access.  For example,  not everyone should have the ability  to launch and terminate resources in a production account.  In fact, maybe no one should.  Not directly, at least.  Having launches and terminations happen through  an enforced change management process,  utilizing an automation tool  to handle changes in the environment,  and providing almost no one direct access  to a production account, would be much safer.  An alternative to this would be  providing open access to the services needed  to manage the environmental changes.  In the first scenario,  it does require more learning and setup,  but once you're done,  you've used a streamlined and fairly simple process  to keep your production environments safer.  And though mistakes could possibly still happen,  they would be rare.  You could also use other services and techniques  to protect against any gaps you're now seeing  in the security.  With the second scenario,  you're giving more people access  to your production environments  and opening the doors to accidental deletions,  data loss, and downtime.  Additionally,  especially for compliance and tracing purposes,  you should be looking at  how you will audit access to your accounts and services.  AWS CloudTrail can be used to provide visibility  and insight into activities performed  by users, roles, services, and API activity.  This level of discovery enables you to identify, evaluate,  and troubleshoot operational and security issues.  And by connecting CloudTrail to other services,  such as Amazon CloudWatch,  you can enforce compliance and set up alerts  to remain aware of any activity  that doesn't match the compliance requirements.  With just the use of IAM, CloudWatch, and CloudTrail,  you could have secure access and event tracking in place,  as well as alarms to trigger and notify,  should anything outside of your enforced rules  be attempted in your accounts.  As you can see,  security and compliance are connected to everything,  and at every stage of your use of AWS.  For the exam, you'll want to consider security,  even if the question doesn't specifically dictate security  as a requirement for an answer.  If two solutions look correct,  but one is more secure than the other,  you should go for the more-secure solution.  For your real-world usage,  understand how interconnected security is,  and focus on the concepts and services  at every step of your design, planning, and implementation.  This will make it much easier,  and you'll be working to avoid needing  to backfit security into your already-built environments.
