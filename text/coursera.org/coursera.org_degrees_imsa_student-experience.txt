Student ExperienceTechnical excellence is a given. Hiring outstanding faculty, admitting students with exceptional credentials, delivering innovative and market-relevant accounting curriculum, and preparing students to pass the CPA exam are essential ingredients of our leading accounting masterâs programs. At Gies, we take all of these areas seriously. We teach students to develop and apply an analytics-oriented mindset to a variety of accounting scenarios, including financial accounting, audit and tax, advisory and managerial, and forensics. Practicing skills is an equally important component of learning. At Gies, we create opportunities for our students to learn through practicing key technical and non-technical business skills. The results are invaluable and foster personal and professional development.The iMSA program is fully developed and taught by Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois. The University of Illinois leverages Courseraâs online education platform to deliver the program curriculum, allowing iMSA students to benefit from Coursera features such as interactive video transcription, in-course note taking, and seamless learning across multiple devices.What are students saying?Mario Elizalde: "Thanks to Gies online I can say I am fluent in the language of business. Itâs not just about the degree or being able to enhance my resume. It is about the confidence and the satisfaction I have from truly mastering a topic I am passionate about." Michelle Lubbe:  "The flexible design of the iMSA program fits perfectly into my busy life.  All the resources I need are on my laptop making it easy to stay engaged with my courses even when I am traveling and during busy days at work.  The program effectively uses Zoom, Coursera, online office hours, discussion boards, class recordings, and online quizzes and homework to connect with my professors and classmates and make the learning process more convenient.
