This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

DevOps process can be visualized as an infinite loop, comprising these steps: plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor. Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and communicate to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality. This course in the DevOps on AWS specialization focuses on code, build and test parts of the workflow. We will discuss topics such as source control, best practices for Continuous Integration, and how to use the right tools to measure code quality, by identifying workflow steps that could be automated.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnDevops, Test Automation, AWS cloudReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarHalf-Filled Star4.6 (139 ratings)5 stars72.66%4 stars19.42%3 stars7.19%1 star0.71%BMJan 22, 2023Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarIt is a really good course I have learned about aws cloud9, code build. code commit, and also aws SAMHelpful?MUNov 5, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarExcellent Course but much better if the instructor speak slowly and show the labs with details.Helpful?From the lessonWeek 2In the second week, you will discover why itâs important for teams to incorporate testing into the software development lifecycle at different stages of the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. You will get hands-on with AWS solutions by performing various application tests with AWS CodeBuild, automate your release process with AWS CodePipeline, and automate code deployments with AWS CodeDeploy.The Test7:55Exercise 2 Introduction1:33Automate Testing8:22Exercise 3 Introduction0:59Taught ByRafael LopesPrincipal Cloud TechnologistRussell SayersSenior Cloud TechnologistAlana LaytonTechnical Curriculum DeveloperTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Alana] We have our set of tests  running in our local environments.  As a new developer, coming on board to our projects,  you can clone the source code and run tests.  That way, you're confident  you have the code in a good state.  As you work on the code,  you can keep adding to the tests and running existing tests  to be sure that they aren't causing any regression.  This is really just a test for it works on my machine.  For example, I might forget to include a library  in the source.  But the library is present in my environment,  so the build passes.  But another developer clones the source  and encounters errors, because the library isn't present.  Breaking the build like this can have  a pretty significant impact on  your team productivity,  while we trace through errors that are happening here,  but not happening there.  So we need to build and test in a clean environment  off our laptops.  We've already seen AWS CodeBuild  for building and packaging an application,  and running our tests.  CodeBuild will provision a clean  and consistent environment to install  our test prerequisites, tools, and run tests.  Here's Russ to show you a bit more about this.  - [Russ] Let's compare the local build script  and the buildspec used to run  the same steps inside CodeBuild.  The local build first runs Pylint with a single parameter.  That's the location of the Lambda function code.  Pylint is a static analyzer, or linter, for Python code.  This tests that we are writing code  to the same, standardized conventions.  Things like variable naming and unused code  will be detected here.  Having a team coding convention will make  the code less individualized.  If we are all sticking to the same convention,  code will be more predictable and easier  to read for others on the team.  Next, the code runs pytest.  The parameters for pytest  give the directory location of the unit tests.  Then, the type of report we want,  in this case, a HTML report.  The last two parameters include code coverage and the tests.  Code coverage will give us a report of which lines of code  are being exercised by the tests.  If I'm adding some conditional code to the application,  this will show that the condition isn't being tested,  if the code isn't being exercised.  Now, let's look at how this would move to a buildspec file.  This is going to look very similar to the steps you did  manually, in the unit testing exercise.  In the install phase,  we installed two packages, we need to test the code.  This is exactly what we did manually  in our local environments.  In the build phase, just like the local build,  we have Pylint and pytest.  This is very similar to the local build,  but we're passing different parameters for the unit tests  and the coverage report.  Previously, we were building a HTML report  for a human to read.  This time, we want an XML report.  The consumer of this report is going to be CodeBuild.  Here, in the report section,  we have settings that use the XML unit test report  and the coverage report.  CodeBuild supports several test file formats.  For example, Cucumber, JUnit, NUnit.  With this, we'll be able to see the results  of our tests in the CodeBuild console.  Now is a good time to talk about debugging and  troubleshooting anything we are doing inside of CodeBuild.  We are looking at a failed build.  The first step of any debugging will be checking the logs.  From inside the console, we've seen  that we can see the output of a build.  The output here is going to be the number one  source of help when debugging.  Okay, I've seen the output from my build.  I think I have a fix.  I could just commit the fix,  but I want to get confident the fix will work  before I push anything to the code repository.  CodeBuild builds are run  with a Docker image you configure.  The Docker files used to create CodeBuild images  are made available in a GitHub repository on your screen.  I'll include a link to this in the course readings.  You can build the same image CodeBuild is using  to run your builds, and then launch this  image locally to test your build.  Let's see what this looks like.  I cloned the Git repository.  I'm interested in the Ubuntu Standard 5 image that is  being used in the exercises.  I can build the image on my laptop.  There was a lot going into that image,  but I already have it built on my laptop,  so it completes pretty quickly.  Let's launch a Bash shell inside of the container.  I want to use my source inside the container.  So I'll use a -v mount for my code.  Inside the container, I have lots of build tools available,  like Java, Python,  Go,  and Node on here.  I can change over to the app directory,  where I have my code mounted.  From here, I can test my build commands, like go build.  I see the same error I was seeing in the CodeBuild console.  I can make a test fix in the container  before I push anything to Git.  Testing builds in a local Docker container  makes it easy to test our builds in the same consistent  environment that will be used by CodeBuild.  What steps would you take if you still cannot  reproduce your issue locally?  Now, I would be thinking about using  a Session Manager feature  to connect to a running build.  CodeBuild supports pausing the build,  and using Session Manager  to connect to the build container.  To do this, there are three things I need in my build.  To pause a build, I add a CodeBuild breakpoint command  in the build phase of my buildspec file.  I need to make sure the role associated with my build  has permissions to create and open channels  in AWS Systems Manager.  Lastly, I need to launch the build  with session connections enabled.  Back inside the CodeBuild console,  I can Start build with overrides.  Advanced build overrides.  And under Environment,  I Enable session connection.  The build will be submitted, queued, and provisioned.  And once we're in the build phase,  we'll pause the build and we'll be able to connect to it.  I see a message telling me the build has paused,  and I can connect to it with using Session Manager.  Now in my browser,  I'm inside a shell in the container,  running my build.  I'm going to have to launch a Bash shell.  If I look at the environment variables,  I see the environment variables  that were set by CodeBuild.  If I list the files in this directory,  (typing)  I see my code.  I can use the commands that I would use in my build.  (typing)  I can now debug my build interactively.  When I'm finished with my debugging,  I can codebuild-resume,  and the build will continue.  Let's go over the three methods we use to debug a build.  We have log output from builds.  We can run the same containers  CodeBuild uses in a local environment.  And finally, we can pause the running build,  and use Session Manager to connect to the build.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
