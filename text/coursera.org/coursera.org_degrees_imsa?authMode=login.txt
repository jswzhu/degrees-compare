Chevron RightAre there any prerequisites?âIn general, we expect applicants to have completed a course in business management along with a one- or two- course sequence in principles of accounting or a course in financial accounting. If you are missing any prerequisites for the full degree, you can complete Coursera courses to demonstrate readiness and strengthen your application for the iMSA:The three courses below, in combination, will satisfy the principles of accounting prerequisite.Financial Accounting - FoundationsFinancial Accounting - Advanced TopicsFormal Financial AccountingFor the business management course prerequisite we offer a course titled Business Strategy. You will want to make sure that you earn a course completion certificate for each course, so you can prove that youâve successfully completed them.âChevron RightCan I apply to the degree program even if I donât meet the GPA requirement? âIf you donât meet the GPA requirement but are still very interested in applying, you may consider applying to our Performance-based Admissions Track (PAT). You will undergo the same rigorous application review as a degree-seeking student, including a possible interview. If admitted into the PAT program, you will take a set of two iMSA courses, and upon completion (cumulative GPA or 3.0 or better, including a B or better in both courses) you will automatically be admitted to the iMSA program as a degree-seeking student. The credits earned in those two courses will be transferred toward your MSA degree. Click here for more details.âChevron RightCan I earn credit at the University of Illinois without applying to the degree program?âYes, you can enroll as a non-degree student at the University of Illinois to earn official university credit through relevant online for-credit high-engagement courses while completing open online courses on Coursera. To submit the short application to enroll as a for-credit, non degree student, go to https://onlinemsa.illinois.edu/overview/access-points/credit/âChevron RightCan I try some of the courses before applying? âYes, you can get started with these Specializations and courses on Coursera to try out the degree program before you apply. If you apply and are accepted to the program, your work counts towards your degree learning. âChevron RightCan I use any of my past credits toward the iMSA degree requirements?âA maximum of 12 credit hours can be transferred. Transfer requests must be submitted with the application. Requests for transfer credits will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed even if the following criteria are met.School must be an AACSB-accredited institution.Course(s) must have been completed within the past 4 years.Course(s) must not have been used towards any other degree.Course(s) must have been taken at the graduate level.Student must have earned an A- or better.âChevron RightDo I have to pay for the entire degree upfront?âNo. You pay tuition when you enroll in each individual course ($850 per credit hour for accountancy courses and $307 for non-accounting electives). That means youâll only pay for your courses as you take them.âChevron RightDo I have to submit official transcripts and degree certificates to apply?âYes, but this can wait until you receive an admissions decision. We can review your application based on unofficial copies of these documents uploaded in your online application. If you have been admitted to the iMSA program, you have to request that the educational institution which issued those transcripts and degree certificates mail your official and original transcripts and degree certificates in a sealed envelope directly to us.âChevron RightDo I have to take the GMAT or GRE to apply?âThe GMAT or GRE is not required for the application, but you are welcome to submit scores to supplement your application. Unofficial scores can be loaded into your application, but your official GMAT scores must be sent directly to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: Institution Code â 1836.
âChevron RightDo you need a master's degree in accounting?âYou donât necessarily need a masterâs degree in accounting to be an accountant. However, in order to sit for the CPA exam, you need 150 credit hours, equal to 5 years of school. A masterâs degree can be a great way to advance your career while earning these additional credits to sit for the exam.âChevron RightHow do I apply for the program?âTo enroll in for-credit courses and earn the accredited iMSA degree, you must be admitted as a degree-seeking student through the University of Illinois Graduate College.Apply here. You'll first create an account if you don't already have one. After accessing the application system, simply select Accountancy as the program and Accountancy MS (online)âiMSA as the degree program to begin. For more information about the admission process and requirements, visit the University of Illinois iMSA website or request more information. When submitting your application, select Online Master of Science In Accountancy as your Program of Interest.âChevron RightI'm not interested in the full MSA. Can I take a few courses?âYes, each open course is available separately, with or without high-engagement courses that accompany it.âChevron RightIs a CPA equivalent to a masters degreeâA CPA (Certified Public Accountant) is a professional accountant who has met state-level certification and work experience requirements and has passed the CPA examination. It is not equivalent to a graduate-level degree or masterâs degree in accounting. In order to sit for the CPA exam, professionals need at least 150 credit hours. Since a typical bachelorâs degree is 120 credit hours, many CPA candidates enroll in a masterâs degree in order to fulfill the full credit hours needed to sit for the exam.âChevron RightIs a master's degree in accounting worth it?âThat is entirely dependent on what you are is looking to achieve. If you are looking to earn the 150 credits required to sit for the CPA exam, a masterâs degree can help you earn these credits while also earning a valuable credential to carry with you for the rest of their careers. In addition, a graduate-level degree in accounting can provide connection with some of the brightest minds in the field, especially when you are looking at top-ranked programs.âChevron RightIs financial aid available?âDomestic, degree-seeking students may qualify for student aid. To learn more and to apply for financial aid please visit http://www.osfa.illinois.edu/. Coursera financial aid is available for the open courses components of the iMSA.

For more information, take a look at this blog post on what you can do with an accounting degree.âChevron RightWhat degree do I earn from this program?âUpon successful completion of the program, you will earn a full Master of Science in Accountancy from the University of Illinois, the same degree you would earn if you attended classes on campus.âChevron RightWhich is better, a master's in accounting or an MBA?âA masterâs degree in accounting often is a shorter, more specific degree than an MBA program. While they both provide notable ROI, if a professional is more interested in diving deeper specifically into the world of accounting, data analytics, and finance - a masterâs in accounting makes more sense.The iMSA program is a fully online Master of Science in Accountancy program and welcomes students with a bachelorâs degree in any academic discipline.âChevron RightWill I be eligible to sit for the Uniform CPA exam after I complete the iMSA?âThe University of Illinois has not made a determination as to whether the iMSA program satisfies the academic prerequisites for the CPA exam and licensure in all 55 U.S. jurisdictions.   While the AACSB accredited iMSA program will help you meet the education requirement to sit for the CPA exam, specific requirements to be eligible to take the exam and requirements to become a licensed CPA vary from state to state. In some cases, you may need to take additional coursework or exams to meet individual state requirements and/or you may need to complete background checks to take the CPA exam.  Please review the requirements issued by the Board of Accountancy in your state prior to applying to the iMSA program. Visit the NASBA website for the contact information and a listing of statutes for the State Board of Accountancy in each of the 55 jurisdictions, or the AICPA website to find your stateâs CPA resources and contact information. Becoming a certified public accountant, or CPA, carries numerous benefits such as opportunities to increase your authority and responsibility, and, typically, your salary.âChevron RightWill my diploma state that I was enrolled in an online program?âNo, your diploma will not designate that you completed your degree online. It will simply state that you earned a Master of Science in Accountancy degree from the University of Illinois.âChevron RightWhat tips do you have for applying?âResumeTake your time and be sure to highlight your skills and experience.
