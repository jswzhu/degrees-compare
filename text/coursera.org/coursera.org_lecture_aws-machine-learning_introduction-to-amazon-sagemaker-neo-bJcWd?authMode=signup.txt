Hello, my name is Michelle Metzger and I'm  a technical curriculum developer in  the Training and Certification organization of AWS.  In this video, I'll start by explaining some of  the challenges that our customers are  facing when performing Machine Learning.  Then, introduce you to what Amazon SageMaker Neo is,  and some of its benefits.  I'll walk through a couple of use cases  and wrap up with some key takeaways.  First, let's begin by covering  the concepts and challenges of Machine Learning,  and how Amazon SageMaker Neo addresses some of these.  Nowadays, Machine Learning is universally  used by customers to make informed business decisions.  Developers who want to use  Machine Learning encounter hurdles at every step.  First, they need to choose  a framework that's best-suited for the task at hands.  Second, they need to build  models using their chosen framework.  Third, they need to train a model using  sample data to make  accurate predictions on their data sets.  Forth, they need to  integrate their model with their application.  Finally, they need to deploy the application,  the model, and the framework on a platform.  Amazon SageMaker Neo makes it easy to  build Machine Learning models and get them  ready for training by providing everything you  need to quickly connect to your training data.  It also helps you to select and optimize  the best algorithm and framework for your application.  However, developers still face  hundreds of hurdles when they try to  deploy a model with  optimal performance on multiple platforms.  Let's review a few details about  the realities of model deployment.  To begin with, developers need  to have the specific version of  the framework used for building the models  installed on all of their chosen platforms.  However, platform vendors often limits support to  just one or two frameworks because of the cost and  complexity of optimizing and installing those frameworks.  Not to mention the size of the frameworks themselves,  which limit the type of  platform on which it can be installed.  To work around these limitations,  developers either restrict the model deployment  to fewer platforms or worse,  use a framework that can run on more platforms even  if it's not the best-suited framework  for the task at hand.  In this situation, developers must manually  tune the performance of their models on each platform,  which requires rare skills and  consumes a considerable amount of time.  As a result, developers often have to  settle for sub-optimal performance in their models.  This sub-optimal performance  underutilizes the platform resources,  which increases the overall cost  of the model's deployment.  Ultimately, these hurdles restrict  the diffusion of innovations in Machine Learning.  Developers find themselves in  a situation requiring their solutions  to run on multiple platforms using multiple frameworks.  A machine learning framework provides functions and  operations that developers use  as building blocks for their models.  These functions and operations  differ from framework to framework.  Also, each framework has its own mechanism to save  the models and often has unique file formats.  At runtime, the framework reads the model to generate  the code and runs that code on each unique platform.  This means, that the model can only run on  the framework on the platform in which it was built,  and only on the hardware configuration  on which the framework is supported.  Do you see the problem here?  It is painful to have all of the platforms,  support all of the models from all of the frameworks.  This solution is super messy,  just like you see here.  Amazon SageMaker Neo is designed to  solve the messy problem I just showed you.  It frees a model from  the framework in which it was developed  and allows it to make the best use  of the hardware on which it was deployed.  Now, let's take a look at how Neo works,  and review some of its benefits.  Amazon SageMaker Neo is a new SageMaker capability  that helps developers take  models trained in any framework,  and port them on to any platform while  increasing their performance  and reducing their footprints.  Neo provides model portability by  converting models written in Apache MXNet,  PyTorch, TensorFlow, and XGBoost,  from a framework specific formats into a portable code.  During conversion,  Neo automatically optimizes the model to run  up to two times faster  without a noticeable loss in accuracy.  After conversion, the model  no longer needs the framework,  which reduces its runtime footprint on  the development platform by a 100 times.  Customers can access Neo from the SageMaker console,  and with just a few clicks,  generate a model optimized for their specific platform.  Neo contains two components;  a compiler, and a runtime library.  First, the Neo compiler reads  models saved in various formats.  Those formats used framework  specific functions and operations.  Neo converts those specific functions and operations,  into non-specific functions and operations,  often called Framework Agnostic Representations.  Next, Neo will perform a series of optimizations.  Now here's a high-level explanation  of how Neo could work.  First, the user submits  the compilation job requests to Amazon SageMaker,  and the job status is changed to starting.  After a few moments,  the job status will change to, in-progress.  This is when the process of  compiling the model really begins,  this process can take a while.  Now, during this time,  the user has the ability to stop  the job if they need to for any reason.  When the user stops the job,  the status will be changed to stopping,  Amazon ECS will then begin  the process of stopping the compilation.  Once that is completed,  the job status will then be changed to stop.  Now in most cases,  the user is not going to want to stop  the job right in the middle,  Amazon ECS will then be  allowed to complete the compilation.  Once this is completed,  the job status will then be changed to complete.  So what are the benefits of SageMaker Neo?  Well, earlier I mentioned  the burdens that developers carry  when it comes to developing  Agnostic Machine Learning models.  The prior lack of  simple-to-use profilers and compilers and  Machine Learning had forced developers  into a manual trial and error process,  that is unreliable and quite frankly unproductive.  Enter Amazon SageMaker Neo.  Amazon sage Maker Neo provides  developers with a simple easy to  use tool to perform  the conversion of framework specific models,  and port them to any platform.  Neo automatically optimizes the model  to run up to two times faster,  without a noticeable loss in accuracy.  To optimize the model,  Neo detects and exploits patterns in the input data,  model computation, and platform hardware.  After conversion, the model  can run without needing any framework,  which dramatically reduces the model's runtime footprint.  This allows the model to run in resource constrained,  edge devices, and performance-critical Cloud services.  Let's take a look at a possible use case  for a SageMaker Neo.  Neo enables and accelerates  Machine Learning models both in  the Cloud and at the Edge.  For mobile phone and IoT devices,  Neo can help developers  better deploy image classification,  object detection, and anomaly detection  applications by relaxing  multiple constraints on those devices.  In the Cloud, Neo compiles models to  handle data stored in Amazon S3 buckets,  or coming in as data streams.  Neo also enables new use cases,  such as the integration of  Machine Learning with databases.  Developers will be able to take  Machine Learning models produced by Neo  and run them in databases in  the form of user-defined functions.  These models will enable  complex predictive queries that are currently  impossible or unwieldy to  express in ANSI standard SQL language.  So what are the key takeaways from this video?  Well, SageMaker Neo supports  the most popular deep learning models,  that power computer vision  applications and the most popular decision tree  models currently used in  Amazon SageMaker. Neo optimizes  the performance of AlexNet,  ResNet, VGG, Inception, MobileNet,  SqueezeNet, and DenseNet models,  trained in MXNet, TensorFlow, and even PyTorch.  It also optimizes the performance of classification  and Random Cut Forest models trained in XGBoosts.  Neo supports many different  SageMaker instance types as well.  It supports AWS DeepLens,  Raspberry Pi, Jetson TX1 or TX2 devices,  Amazon Greengrass devices, based on Intel processors,  as well as in video Maxwell and Pascal GPUs.  Developers can train models elsewhere,  and use Neo to optimize them for SageMaker ML instances,  or Greengrass supported devices.  Neo provides model inference modules,  which can run up to two times faster,  while occupying a dramatically reduced memory footprint,  versus previous solutions.  You can use the Neo API to generate  an optimized model for your desired platform,  and you can even deploy and run  that optimized model on  your desired platforms at no additional charge.  I hope you learn just a little something  about Amazon SageMaker Neo,  and we'll continue to explore other AWS videos.  I'm Michelle Metzger with AWS Training and Certification.
