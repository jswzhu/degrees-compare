These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnStatistics, Linear Regression, R Programming, Regression AnalysisReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Star4.8 (1,634 ratings)5 stars80.23%4 stars16.03%3 stars2.93%2 stars0.24%1 star0.55%MMSep 26, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Starlinear regression is well taught throughout the course, but I think learning other types of regression modeling would be useful as well and adding them to the course materials is really good.Helpful?ANSep 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course is structured in a very informative way, it is easy to understand and at the same time difficult concepts are presented in a very easy way.

How does Netflix make personalized movie recommendations?  >> These are the types of questions you can answer with statistical data analysis.  If you'd like to find out more, you've come to the right place.  My name is Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel.  >> My name is David Banks.  >> I am Merlise Clyde.  >> And I'm Colin Rundel.  And we are all faculty members in the Department of Statistical Science at  Duke University.  >> The specialization that we have designed for you, Statistics with R,  is comprised of four courses and a capstone project.  That will introduce you to the discipline of statistics as a science of  understanding and analyzing data and making data-based decisions.  This specialization is designed to be a starting point for  learning to think critically about data.  As well as an introduction to fundamental concepts in frequentist and  Bayesian Statistics.  >> The courses in this specialization are intended for  anyone with an interest in data analysis and statistics.  They require no prior background in statistics or computation.  By the end of this specialization you will have learned how to effectively make use  of data in the face of uncertainty.  How to collect data, how to analyze data and how to use data to make inferences and  draw conclusions about real world phenomenon.  >> As well as touching on some of the traditional methods covered in many  introductory statistics courses, we will also learn about modern and  versatile methods.  Such as simulation-based inference and Bayesian inference.  >> Another critical aspect of modern statistics is computation.  In this specialization you will engage with real data sets using R,  an open source statistical programming language.  The weekly labs will teach you modern R packages as well as how to conduct  data analysis reproducibly.  In these labs we'll delve into questions like whether the hot-hand  phenomena really exists in basketball.  Whether students ratings of professors are based in some part of the professor's  attractiveness.  And how your Google search results are like a slot machine.  Within each course and  as part of the capstone you will be working on an open ended data analysis  project in which you can showcase your statistical skills as you acquire them.  >> Join us as we delve into Statistics with R,  we look forward to interacting with you online soon.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
