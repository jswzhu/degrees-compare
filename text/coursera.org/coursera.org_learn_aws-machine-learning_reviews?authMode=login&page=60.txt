It can be divided in to several short videos. Seeing a long video is creating a boredom. Otherwise it is a very nice course.Helpful?ANApr 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course materials and lecture delivery was just one of a kind,I have learnt a complete skill on Machine Learning and its Algorithms.I hope this will lead me towards a next level of Data science.Helpful?See all 5 star reviewsFilter by:All LearnersChevron DownAll StarsChevron DownSort by:  Most HelpfulChevron Down1476 - 1500 of 1,512 Reviews for Getting Started with AWS Machine LearningFilled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Auraâ¢Jun 4, 2020This was more an advertisement for AWS services rather than a proper course. In some way interesting but I was expecting to learn more about machine learning and work on some projects at least.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Bill Râ¢Sep 18, 2021It is advertised as a certificate course yet there is no certificate associated with the course that I could find. Isn't that false advertising? Otherwise, it was fine.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Nicolas L Gâ¢Jun 27, 2020The title of this course should be "Learn how to sell AWS portfolio". Do not buy this course if you're into practical demonstrations of want to test your skills. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy MB Uâ¢Aug 13, 2020Though some videos are very useful but you can't get the most out of this course if you don't have an AWS web account to practice lectures which is NOT FREE. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Sudharshan Câ¢May 1, 2020A namesake course with videos put together from all over. There is no hands-on experience for us to train on. My first worst experience on Coursera till dateThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Pallav Gâ¢Jun 26, 2020This course felt more like AWS advertising the product to prospective data scientist/developers than the content to actually get started on ML using AWSThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Anuj â¢May 2, 2020Should focus more about core machine learning algorithm and concepts of AWS servicesAnd more MCQ should be there for better screeningThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Giulia Fâ¢Apr 4, 2020Il corso ha poco di Introduttivo: nei termini e negli approcci Ã¨ molto avanzato. Ritengo che manchi tutta la parte di laboratorio.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Jonathan Râ¢Jul 22, 2020first couple videos are ok, everything week 3 on is only useful if you plan on using Amazon's own solutions.  no hands on work.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Rea Fâ¢May 15, 2020A lot of overlap between the videos and it is not possible to practice on AWS platform directly within the courseThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Ernesto L Gâ¢Mar 20, 2020This is a very introductory course where some of the modules were just taken from other courses. Not so good.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy John K A D Gâ¢Aug 22, 2020Its great but the lack of hands-on makes it hard to grasp the concepts taught in the course.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Chanin Tâ¢Jun 1, 2020should allow students to have hand-on experience in the use of Amazon sagemakerThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Sveva Pâ¢Jun 25, 2020  DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE if you're not already a machine learning expert!  This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Muhammad U Sâ¢Oct 14, 2019Assignments should be added, just quizzes were not enough This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarStarStarStarBy Anik Bâ¢Aug 14, 2020Hard to understand for beginners.

I normally rate 4 to 5 stars for the courses, but I can only give one star to this course. I paid 60 CAD and really want to refund it. This course is more like a commercial advertisement than a training course. Every video has different lecturers, and the quality of the content is also varying. Some chapters progress too fast, and some chapters progress too slow. The accents of some instructors are really hard to understand. And the quiz is basically irrelevant to the content. Very disappointed.This is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Gunarto S Nâ¢Jun 11, 2020The content video is repetitive and it does not provide a deep understanding of machine learning. The major drawback is that there is no practical part of this course. To master AWS machine learning, I think exercising a machine learning project using AWS machine learning would be the best. However, that is not provided in the course. My verdict is that do consider again before taking this course or you will waste a lot of your time since most of the video contents are marketing contents by Amazon.This is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Georgi Tâ¢Feb 10, 2021I assumed (bad practice, I know) that this course was going to be about ML-specific AWS technologies, and already expecting the taker to have knowledge about ML. Instead, it was sort of about AWS technologies but lacking detail, and it was about ML in general but again lacking detail, so for me in the end it was neither this nor that.This is helpful Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Pujan Pâ¢Apr 24, 2020if you are stating that it is introductory course for begineer and starting with ml then you are fooling world.You are just trying to showcase excellence of how smart amazon is which is not bad way,but it feels like you are advertising amazon product to consumer.strongly dissappointed  by course curriculam.This is helpful Chevron Left 1 ... 51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61 Chevron Right
