You will learn how to prepare for the exam by exploring the examâs topic areas and how they map to SysOps Administration on AWS. You will review sample certification questions in each domain, practice skills with hands-on exercises, test your knowledge with practice question sets, and learn strategies for identifying incorrect responses by interpreting the concepts that are being tested in the exam. At the end of this course you will have all the knowledge and tools to help you identity your strengths and weaknesses in each certification domain areas that are being tested on the certification exam.

The AWS Certified SysOps Administrator â Associate (SOA-C02) exam is intended for system
administrators in a cloud operations role. The exam validates a candidateâs ability to deploy, manage, and
operate workloads on AWS and their ability to complete the following tasks: Support and maintain AWS workloads according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework, perform operations by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, implement security controls to meet compliance requirements, monitor, log, and troubleshoot systems, apply networking concepts (for example, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls), implement architectural requirements (for example, high availability, performance, capacity), perform business continuity and disaster recovery procedures and identify, classify, and remediate incidentsView SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCloud Computing Security, Software Deployment, AWS cloudFrom the lessonWeek 3Welcome to Week 3! This week, you will get an overview of relevant concepts and services for Reliability and Business Continuity (Domain 2) and Networking and Content Delivery (Domain 5) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in these areas. For Domain 2, the question walkthroughs focus on implementing high availability, implementing scalability, and implementing backup and restore policies. Question walkthroughs for Domain 5 address implementing networking, working with Domain Name System (DNS) services and content delivery, and troubleshooting network issues. An optional exercise for Domain 5 gives you an opportunity to practice configuring an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket through AWS CloudFormation. This exercise has an accompanying video walkthrough that shows one possible solution for completing the exercise.Introduction to Reliability and Business Continuity5:38Question Walkthrough: Implement High Availability3:27Understanding Reliability and Business Continuity2:55Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Blaine] Welcome back.  There are six domains,  each with a different focus,  that together, make up  the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator exam.  Let's look at the Reliability  and Business Continuity domain,  which accounts for 16 percent of the total score.  Reliability and Business Continuity  is all about implementing patterns on AWS  that can scale rapidly,  in and out, automatically.  And part of your job running SysOps in the cloud  is to stop answering pager calls at 3:00 AM  when the system is unexpectedly under load.  This means scaling back in, also  without human intervention,  when those extra resources  are no longer needed.  Operate independently.  Loosely coupled architectures  are critical to systems  that are elastic in nature.  Balance variable traffic,  which can mean network traffic inside a VPC,  or data caching layers,  or even DNS with Route 53.  Tolerate resource failure.  If everything fails all the time,  do you know how to plan for failure,  so nothing actually fails?  Recover and restore.  Just being fault tolerant isn't enough.  Can you recover from disasters,  like that time your VP of Engineering  dropped the customer table  on the production database?  Oh, that one didn't happen to you?  I guess that only happened to me, then.  Sorry, Byron,  didn't mean to call you out like that.  Reliability and Business Continuity  is officially broken down  into three subdomains:  Implement scalability and elasticity.  Implement high availability  and resilient environments.  Implement backup and restore strategies.  Which means you will see questions  from all three subdomains in your exam,  so let's break them down.  As we go through this breakdown,  pay attention to any area  that does not make sense to you.  And that should be an indicator  of where additional study will be needed.  Implementing scalability and elasticity is about  auto scaling EC2 to begin with.  You will need to be familiar  with the different options  available for auto scaling,  and how to use it  to respond to various situations.  But it's also about caching.  Amazon ElastiCache.  And you should know the differences  between a Redis and a Memcached approach.  Amazon CloudFront,  along with the different options there are,  such as object expiration.  DAX, or DynamoDB Accelerator,  is absolutely in play here.  Read replicas for RDS,  and especially Aurora.  Understand how and where they can be deployed.  For example,  which databases actually support  a multi-Region strategy?  And loosely coupled architectures.  Systems that can scale independently on demand,  without needing to coordinate  with other tiers.  Which also means you need to be able  to identify the difference  between scaling up  and scaling out.  Our next subdomain is  Implementing high availability  and resilient environments.  This may include elements like  health checks for load balancers  and Route 53.  Multi-AZ deployments.  Multi-Availability Zone auto scaling  is part of this,  but it also brings RDS options  back on the table,  along with other data solutions,  such as EFS and FSx.  Fault-tolerant workloads that can withstand  the failure of any individual component  without degradation of service.  SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, EFS, S3,  and other Regional services.  And Route 53 routing policies,  such as failover  or latency-based routing,  that can help improve your availability.  The final subdomain is  implementing backup and restore strategies.  Things go wrong, or things could go wrong,  so do you know how to prepare  for those moments,  so what would have been a disaster  ends up just being an incident report?  This is all about snapshots  and backups based on a variety of use cases.  You should understand RTO and RPO,  the Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager,  and how to set up RDS snapshots.  And not just setting up snapshots,  but how to actually restore databases,  such as promoting read replicas  to primary databases,  or using point-in-time restores,  which would have been so nice to have had  before Byron committed that DROP TABLE statement.  (clears throat)  Other considerations in this subdomain  include versioning and lifecycle rules,  Cross-Region Replication,  and all of the main patterns  for executing disaster recovery procedures,  such as pilot light  or warm standby architectures.  All of those together  are the subjects that are in play  for Reliability and Business Continuity.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
