You will learn how to prepare for the exam by exploring the examâs topic areas and how they map to SysOps Administration on AWS. You will review sample certification questions in each domain, practice skills with hands-on exercises, test your knowledge with practice question sets, and learn strategies for identifying incorrect responses by interpreting the concepts that are being tested in the exam. At the end of this course you will have all the knowledge and tools to help you identity your strengths and weaknesses in each certification domain areas that are being tested on the certification exam.

The AWS Certified SysOps Administrator â Associate (SOA-C02) exam is intended for system
administrators in a cloud operations role. The exam validates a candidateâs ability to deploy, manage, and
operate workloads on AWS and their ability to complete the following tasks: Support and maintain AWS workloads according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework, perform operations by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, implement security controls to meet compliance requirements, monitor, log, and troubleshoot systems, apply networking concepts (for example, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls), implement architectural requirements (for example, high availability, performance, capacity), perform business continuity and disaster recovery procedures and identify, classify, and remediate incidentsView SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCloud Computing Security, Software Deployment, AWS cloudFrom the lessonWeek 3Welcome to Week 3! This week, you will get an overview of relevant concepts and services for Reliability and Business Continuity (Domain 2) and Networking and Content Delivery (Domain 5) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in these areas. For Domain 2, the question walkthroughs focus on implementing high availability, implementing scalability, and implementing backup and restore policies. Question walkthroughs for Domain 5 address implementing networking, working with Domain Name System (DNS) services and content delivery, and troubleshooting network issues. An optional exercise for Domain 5 gives you an opportunity to practice configuring an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket through AWS CloudFormation. This exercise has an accompanying video walkthrough that shows one possible solution for completing the exercise.Introduction to Reliability and Business Continuity5:38Question Walkthrough: Implement High Availability3:27Understanding Reliability and Business Continuity2:55Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Seph] You probably have a good idea  of what kinds of things  you need to study to understand reliability  and business continuity for the exam,  but it goes further than that.  To start, the more you comprehend scalability  and elasticity, the better you can implement those methods  into your environments.  And it's not just knowing about Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling,  but also about how you can make use of the various methods  and mechanisms for scaling across the board.  Some scenarios will be perfect  for implementing horizontal scaling,  but what about when you don't need more servers,  but instead, more memory, storage, or compute power?  Sometimes it isn't about adding more processing threads,  but enabling the processing components to handle more.  And in other use cases, scaling looks like decoupling.  A regular need when handling tasks,  especially when the task load can change drastically,  but you want to avoid data loss  due to component failure, is queuing.  If you had an application that needed to process  important requests and needed to be built  for data consistency, a queue would be very helpful.  Without a queue, you could try and horizontally scale  in order to manage the messages,  but not only could that get costly if a server went down,  the request it was processing could be lost.  Utilizing something like Amazon Simple Queue Service  could help in a couple of ways here.  One, deploying the queue would help you  to fine-tune your scaling.  Instead of continuing to add more servers,  your servers would have a maximum number that you'd run,  and the queue would handle holding on to the requests  until a component freed up to process another message.  You'd be able to continually receive messages,  but wouldn't have to launch an endless number of servers  to handle them.  And two, the queue would be able to hold  a message until it was successfully processed.  If a processing server crashed, its data loss wouldn't mean  the complete loss of the request.  So, with the addition of a decoupled queue,  you could implement elasticity, add resiliency,  and minimize data loss for your application.  Reliability and business continuity go even further,  and its methods can be employed in different ways  across a wide variety of services.  This is just one example, but elasticity,  consistency, and resiliency tactics can be utilized  whether you're looking  at Amazon Relational Database Service,  Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon Route 53,  and nearly any service in between.  Look at your architectures and evaluate  how they can be modified and improved with a focus  on reliability and business continuity.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
