This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

DevOps process can be visualized as an infinite loop, comprising these steps: plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor. Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and communicate to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality. This course in the DevOps on AWS specialization focuses on code, build and test parts of the workflow. We will discuss topics such as source control, best practices for Continuous Integration, and how to use the right tools to measure code quality, by identifying workflow steps that could be automated.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnDevops, Test Automation, AWS cloudReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarHalf-Filled Star4.6 (139 ratings)5 stars72.66%4 stars19.42%3 stars7.19%1 star0.71%BMJan 22, 2023Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarIt is a really good course I have learned about aws cloud9, code build. code commit, and also aws SAMHelpful?MUNov 5, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarExcellent Course but much better if the instructor speak slowly and show the labs with details.Helpful?From the lessonWeek 1This week, you will be introduced to DevOps cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that you can use to deliver applications and services faster and at a higher quality.

The course that will talk about the Code, Build  and Test parts of the DevOps workflow.  My name is Rafael Lopes, but you can call me Raf,  and I will be one of your instructors for this course.  Russ and Alana will also join the party with videos,  screen captures, virtual whiteboards,  and hands-on activities.  I'm pretty sure it will be fun for you to watch  as it was for us to create and record this content for you.  If you work on writing software  that gets in front of customers  and want to get a better understanding  on how to apply some DevOps practice  to your current workloads, this course is for you.  You will explore AWS services  that will help your application delivery  like AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline.  When developing code,  we always have to ask ourselves questions, such as:  Are the current practices quickly getting stable,  innovative software in front of your customers?  And can we leverage DevOps automation  to gain the competitive advantage  that comes from better workflows?  We know that software is a critical component  for many organizations that want to optimize their products  and solutions by reducing time to market  and create more robust code.  Adopting the culture of automation  is the key to achieve that.  So, in this first course of the DevOps series,  we will focus on the Code, Build, and Test aspects  of the DevOps operation.  We will get into topics like source control,  best practice for continuous integration,  and how to use the right tools to measure code quality  by identifying workflow steps that could be automated.  With automation comes confidence,  and with confidence comes the optimization  of time-consuming processes,  resulting in better quality software  that can be built faster.  Join me, Alana, and Russ for the first course  of the DevOps on AWS series on this platform.  Let's talk about Code, Build, and Test.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
