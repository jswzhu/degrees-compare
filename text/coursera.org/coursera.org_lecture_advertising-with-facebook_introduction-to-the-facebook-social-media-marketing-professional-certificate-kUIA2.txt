My name is Anke and I will be your guide and  one of your teachers through this exciting journey.  Since you're here, I probably don't have to convince you that social media is  shaping how we live and do business today.  Social media has the power to change lives and businesses beyond recognition.  It can launch products into stratospheric success in brand new ways.  And give immediate access to millions of customers,  literally delivering messages into their pockets.  We learn of good news, sports results, births and  birthdays, our friends' trips, weddings, first school days,  latest dance moves and cookouts, all in the blink of an eye or  the scroll of our thumb and social media is what frames our reactions.  It's the construct we use to connect to others and to tell our stories.  Social media is a perfect medium for getting your story out there and for  connecting with people.  That's true for your personal story, but social media also offers a platform for  businesses to connect to customers and potential customers.  Which has opened a whole new world for marketing.  With social media, marketers can become part of the conversation and  when done well, social media marketing can help businesses launch products,  generate sales, and provide excellent customer service.  Good social media marketing involves making authentic connections and  providing value through content and interaction.  It's a bit of a mix between art and science and  this program will provide you with all the skills and tools you need to do it well.  Whether you're looking to start a career in social media marketing,  whether you work for a Fortune 500 company, a tiny little mom and  pop shop, or are simply interested in marketing your own brand and story  on social media then this is the course for you.  You don't need any experience to get started,  we'll start from the very beginning.  The only thing you need is an appetite for social media,  willingness to put stories out there, and a Facebook or Instagram account.  This program will look at all aspects of social media marketing.  And while we will cover all the important social media platforms we'll focus  quite a bit on Facebook and Instagram.  These apps are central to the social media marketing world and  mastering those applications will set you up for future success.
