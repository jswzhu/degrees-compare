Along with furthering my career is a better financial situationâor a salary total compensation increase. Since Iâve been in the program...Iâve seen a promotion to the CMO level and a 43% compensation increase. Itâs really been just a great move, a life changing experience and just so enjoyable all around."Keisha Craig-Ottley: "My favorite thing about the program is the vibrant community of learners. My peers just a click away, always ready to share advice, information, tips, and whatever I need. This is an unparalleled asset in an online program. You feel connected and supported, which is truly extraordinary."Troy Parish: "Prior to applying to the iMBA program, I completed two MOOCs on the Coursera platform, and I started applying concepts I learned right away. In researching various advanced programs, I realized that Giesâ iMBA, a premier program, with its capstone courses to bring all the tools in my toolbox together, would be perfect; it is the learning experience I was looking for with hands-on projects, group work, and problem solving."Have questions?
