These services simplify provisioning and managing infrastructure, deploying application code, automating software release processes, and monitoring your application and infrastructure performance. The third course in the series explains how to improve the deployment process with DevOps methodology, and also some tools that might make deployments easier, such as Infrastructure as Code, or IaC, and AWS CodeDeploy.

The course begins with reviewing topics covered in the first course of the DevOps on AWS series. You will learn about the differences between continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. In Exercises 1 and 2, you will set up AWS CodeDeploy and make revisions that will then be deployed. If you use AWS Lambda, you will explore ways to address additional considerations when you deploy updates to your Lambda functions.

Next, you will explore how infrastructure as code (IaC) helps organizations achieve automation, and which AWS solutions provide a DevOps-focused way of creating and maintaining infrastructure. In Exercise 3, you will be provided with an AWS CloudFormation template that will set up backend services, such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodeBuild. You will then upload new revisions to the pipeline.Flexible deadlinesFlexible deadlinesReset deadlines in accordance to your schedule.Shareable CertificateShareable CertificateEarn a Certificate upon completion100% online100% onlineStart instantly and learn at your own schedule.SpecializationCourse 3 of 4 in theDevOps on AWS SpecializationIntermediate LevelIntermediate LevelHours to completeApprox. 4 hours to completeAvailable languagesEnglishSubtitles: EnglishCould your company benefit from training employees on in-demand skills?Try Coursera for BusinessSkills you will gainawsContinuous IntegrationContinuous DeliveryDevopsFlexible deadlinesFlexible deadlinesReset deadlines in accordance to your schedule.Shareable CertificateShareable CertificateEarn a Certificate upon completion100% online100% onlineStart instantly and learn at your own schedule.SpecializationCourse 3 of 4 in theDevOps on AWS SpecializationIntermediate LevelIntermediate LevelHours to completeApprox. 4 hours to completeAvailable languagesEnglishSubtitles: EnglishCould your company benefit from training employees on in-demand skills?Try Coursera for BusinessInstructorsInstructor rating 5/5Â (11 Ratings)Rafael LopesPrincipal Cloud TechnologistAWS Training & Certification 65,213 Learners 8 CoursesRussell SayersSenior Cloud Technologist 32,204 Learners 8 CoursesAlana LaytonTop InstructorTechnical Curriculum Developer 149,807 Learners 6 CoursesOffered byAmazon Web ServicesSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the worldâs most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.
