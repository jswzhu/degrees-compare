Tuition & FeesTuition is $667 per credit hour and $20,010 for the full 30-credit masterâs degree. With âpay-as-you-goâ tuition, you only need to pay for the courses you are taking in the upcoming term at the time of enrollment. Learn more about the different payment options.We encourage you to seek tuition reimbursement through your employer. We recommend that you speak with your manager or HR department to see whatâs available to you as an employee.Please note:Tuition payments cannot be rolled over to future sessions. If a credit card payment does not process successfully, a financial hold will be placed on the studentâs account. If a successful transaction does not occur by the end of the current session, a âWâ grade will be given automatically. W grades have no bearing on the GPA and credit total.Additional software or hardware may be required for some courses payable by the student.Financial AidThis program is not currently eligible for U.S. federal financial aid.To learn more about financing your degree, visit the Degrees Financial Resources Hub.Admissions InformationEnrollment for the Spring 1 2023 session is now open!Important DatesJanuary 2: Spring 1 Enrollment opensJanuary 16: Spring 1 Classes startFebruary 24: Spring 1 Enrollment closesCoursera does not grant credit, and does not represent that any institution other than the degree granting institution will recognize the credit or credential awarded by the institution; the decision to grant, accept, or transfer credit is subject to the sole and absolute discretion of an educational institution.Coursera FooterStart or advance your careerGoogle Data AnalystGoogle Digital Marketing & E-commerce Professional CertificateGoogle IT Automation with Python Professional CertificateGoogle IT SupportGoogle Project ManagementGoogle UX DesignPreparing for Google Cloud Certification: Cloud ArchitectIBM Cybersecurity AnalystIBM Data AnalystIBM Data EngineeringIBM Data ScienceIBM Full Stack Cloud DeveloperIBM Machine LearningIntuit BookkeepingMeta Front-End DeveloperDeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional CertificateSAS Programmer Professional CertificateLaunch your careerPrepare for a certificationAdvance your careerHow to Identify Python Syntax ErrorsHow to Catch Python ExceptionsSee all Programming TutorialsPopular Courses and CertificationsFree CoursesArtificial Intelligence CoursesBlockchain CoursesComputer Science CoursesCursos GratisCybersecurity CoursesData Analysis CoursesData Science CoursesEnglish Speaking CoursesFull Stack Web Development CoursesGoogle CoursesHuman Resources CoursesIT CoursesLearning English CoursesMicrosoft Excel CoursesProduct Management CoursesProject Management CoursesPython CoursesSQL CoursesAgile CertificationsCAPM CertificationCompTIA A+ CertificationData Analytics CertificationsScrum Master CertificationsSee all coursesPopular collections and articlesFree online courses you can finish in a dayPopular Free CoursesBusiness JobsCybersecurity JobsEntry-Level IT JobsData Analyst Interview QuestionsData Analytics ProjectsHow to Become a Data AnalystHow to Become a Project ManagerIT SkillsProject Manager Interview QuestionsPython Programming SkillsStrength and Weakness in InterviewWhat Does a Data Analyst DoWhat Does a Software Engineer DoWhat Is a Data EngineerWhat Is a Data ScientistWhat Is a Product DesignerWhat Is a Scrum MasterWhat Is a UX ResearcherHow to Get a PMP CertificationPMI CertificationsPopular Cybersecurity CertificationsPopular SQL CertificationsRead all Coursera ArticlesEarn a degree or certificate onlineGoogle Professional CertificatesProfessional CertificatesSee all certificatesBachelor's DegreesMaster's DegreesComputer Science DegreesData Science DegreesMBA & Business DegreesData Analytics DegreesPublic Health DegreesSocial Sciences DegreesManagement DegreesBA vs BS DegreeWhat is a Bachelor's Degree?11 Good Study Habits to DevelopHow to Write a Letter of Recommendation10 In-Demand Jobs You Can Get with a Business DegreeIs a Master's in Computer Science Worth it?See all degree programsCoursera IndiaCoursera UKCoursera MexicoCourseraAboutWhat We OfferLeadershipCareersCatalogCoursera PlusProfessional CertificatesMasterTrackÂ® CertificatesDegreesFor EnterpriseFor GovernmentFor CampusBecome a PartnerCoronavirus ResponseCommunityLearnersPartnersBeta TestersTranslatorsBlogTech BlogTeaching CenterMorePressInvestorsTermsPrivacyHelpAccessibilityContactArticlesDirectoryAffiliatesModern Slavery StatementLearn AnywhereÂ© 2023 Coursera Inc.
