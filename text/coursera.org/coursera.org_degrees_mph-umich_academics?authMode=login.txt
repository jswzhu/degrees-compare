Graduate Certificate ProgramsAs you earn your MPH degree from Michigan Public Health, enrolled students also have the opportunity to pursue additional educational credentials via Graduate Certificate programs. The online MPH offers a variety of elective series designed to earn a University of Michigan School of Public Health graduate certificate in a specific area within a core public health discipline. The graduate certificate denotes a studentâs depth of knowledge in the given subject area such as Analyzing Health Data, Health Behavior and Health Equity, Healthcare Accounting and Finance, and more. Certificates are earned through the completion of pre-built elective course series.  Learn more about certificate programs available to MPH students.Online certificate programs are only available to enrolled students in the online Master of Public Health program at Michigan Public Health. Online certificates may not be elected or audited independently of the masterâs degree curriculum. Students will work with their Michigan Public Health advisor to elect chosen certificate programs before their second year in the masterâs program. MPH Graduate Certificates are academic credentials administered by the University of Michigan School of Public Health, not to be confused with course certificates acquired through Coursera.Capstone Projects*Applied Practice and Integrative Experience (2 cr Fall + 2 cr Winter):  A key element of the MPH will be an integrated applied practice experience and culminating capstone (4 credits), which gives students exposure to the practical demands of working in the public health field and requires the integration of knowledge with skills and the application of competencies in practice. The applied practice experience can occur in any term of the second year and the practice activity/project is flexible in order to meet studentsâ interests in public health.The CEPH accreditation criteria for the applied practice experience dictates that the experience must a) involve an external practice partner, b) build off of the didactic component of three core competencies and c) result in two written products that are provided to the external partner. An example of a project/product that could be done in all 50 states is the analysis of the state's annual BRFSS data and the development of an executive summary, PowerPoint presentation, and detailed report on a state's health indicators for a department of health. Performing and writing up health assessments for communities with a local or global partner is another meaningful but systematic way to benefit both student and public health agency. The culminating integrative experience for the MPH students should be completed during the final term of the program. Students will develop a culminating high-level integrated written product (e.g. policy brief, program plan, research paper, community health needs assessment) relevant to a real world applied health problem synthesizing competencies achieved throughout the program. The online MPH is your chance to earn a Master of Public Health degree from a top-ranked program without pausing your career. You'll take the same kind of courses youâd attend on campus, with the flexibility to learn when and where you want. Through the program, youâll collaborate with a global network of classmates, instructors, and alumni.Coursera on MobileStudents can access all of their course materials wherever they are with the mobile app. The app is used by over 80 percent of online degree students on Coursera and is available on iOS and Android.
