CurriculumThe Global Master of Public Health degree is a fully online degree part-time programme.  Imperial College London offers a number of enrollment options to provide a learning experience to suit your existing work and family commitments.The Masterâs level programmes are delivered and structured over either two years or three years, with three terms per academic year.You can either:enrol on the two year Masterâs programme as a standalone pathway, where you will study three specialisations per term (approx. 16-24 hours study time per week over 2 years), or;build to the Masterâs qualification over three years (approx. 12-18 hours per week). When you graduate, youâll be able to:Apply health research methods, including epidemiology and biostatistics.Become a global public health professional and build a strong career leading to roles at institutions such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization.Develop towards leading roles in fields like public health analysis, communicable disease control, environmental epidemiology, and global health policy.Two year Master's Core specialisations focus on building core skills and knowledge in epidemiology, the spread and prevention of disease, statistical analysis and modelling, public health practice and global health challenges.Students build a degree that best suits their interests, through the selection of 4 elective specialisations (out of a choice of 8), allowing students to focus efforts on areas of study most important to them and their future public health careers.All GMPH students will be required to complete a substantive research output, across a number of core specialisations in the research portfolio, which accounts for a third of the course. During the first half of the portfolio, students gain key knowledge and skills required to design, plan, conduct, analyse and disseminate research in public health through three taught specialisations (research portfolios 1 â 3). Within these specialisations, students develop their own research in a fully supported learning environment.Students will finish their research portfolio in the second half, which will lead to a draft paper (academic or policy), blog and dissemination plan. Students will be supported throughout their project and will enjoy a consistent level of supervision and structured study.Three year MasterâsFor the three year Masterâs programme, students must first enrol on a one year Postgraduate Certificate programme. Students who complete the Certificate will have the option to continue on to study for a one year Postgraduate Diploma, followed by the option of a final year to achieve the Masterâs qualification.By the end of the Postgraduate Certificate programme, you will have gained an understanding of the basic foundations of public health, having completed the core specialisations of Epidemiology for Public Health, Foundations of Public Health Practice, Statistics for Public Health, Population Health Improvement and a choice of two electives, allowing you to choose/specialise at this level in areas of your own interest. The PG Diploma will allow you to develop and build upon your knowledge and skills with further choice and specialised subjects within public health, directed towards your own public health practice and research. You will be required to complete all  4 core specialisations (Global Diseases Masterclass, Global Health Governance and Challenges, and Health Systems Development). You can then choose a further two electives. This level also requires you to undertake Research Portfolio 1: Designing a Research Study. This specialisation will provide you with the basic/foundation understanding of research practice.The Masterâs will allow you to continue to build upon your knowledge and skills, and the majority of this level requires you to undertake the remaining Research Portfolio core specialisations, building your own research practice and skills at this level to completion of your project. You will also be required to undertake the core Health Economics specialisation and have 1 further elective choice. Within each pathway core, specialisations focus on building core skills and knowledge in epidemiology, the spread and prevention of disease, statistical analysis and modelling, public health practice and global health challenges.
