You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnStatistics, R Programming, Rstudio, Exploratory Data AnalysisReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarHalf-Filled Star4.7 (5,382 ratings)5 stars78.26%4 stars17.42%3 stars2.43%2 stars0.65%1 star1.22%AAJan 23, 2018Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThis course literally taught me a lot, the concepts were beautifully explained but the way it was delivered and overall exercises and the difficulty of problems made it more challenging and enjoying.Helpful?BBSep 3, 2019Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarVery clearly explained and the pace is awesome! I really enjoy each deadline and l can already see how it is impacting my day to day work and life. I ook forward to completing the course! Thank you.Helpful?From the lessonIntroduction to DataWelcome to Introduction to Probability and Data! I hope you are just as excited about this course as I am! In the next five weeks, we will learn about designing studies, explore data via numerical summaries and visualizations, and learn about rules of probability and commonly used probability distributions.

Let's start with a historical look at data as evidence.  In the United States, anti-smoking research started in the 1930s  when cigarette smoking became increasingly popular.  While some smokers seemed to be sensitive to cigarette smoke,  others were completely unaffected.  Anti-smoking research was faced with resistance based on claims like,  my uncle smokes three packs a day and he's in perfectly good health.  Such evidence, while maybe real, is based on a limited sample size that might not  be representative of the population.  We call such evidence anecdotal evidence.  At the time, it was concluded that smoking is a complex human behavior,  by its nature difficult to study, confounded by human variability.  However today,  our understanding of the health effects of smoking is much different.  In time, researchers were able to examine larger samples of cases.  In other words, more smokers.  And with data collected from a larger sample over time,  trends showing negative health impacts of smoking became much clearer.  The goal of this course is to teach you to make sense of data using statistical  tools, in order to be able to explore relationships between variables and  make informed decisions.  Throughout the course, you will be introduced to numerous studies.  And when faced with a new study or a data set, the first question you should always  ask yourself is, what is the population of interest, and what is the sample?  For example, let's consider this study titled Alcohol Brand Use and  Injury in the Emergency Department, published in 2013.  This study explored the research question, are consumers of certain alcohol  brands more likely to end up in the emergency room with injuries?  Based on this question alone,  it appears that the population of interest is everyone.  In other words, ideally,  the researchers would like to find an answer to this question  that can result in a recommendation for everyone who consumes alcohol.  However, a closer look at this study reveals that the sample used in this study  was only a group of emergency room patients at the Johns Hopkins Hospital  in Baltimore in the US.  These are patients who visited the hospital with an injury.  And alcohol brand consumption data were collected from patients who drank within  six hours of presentation at the hospital.  Therefore the results of the study can really only be generalized to  residents of Baltimore, since certain brands maybe more easily  available in this area than others due to national brand market share.  Similarly there may be transient alcohol consumption habits of people  who live in this area versus everywhere else in the world.  Now that you are a little more familiar with how to approach statistical studies,  let's give a brief overview of what's to come in this unit.  We will start by defining populations of interest,  discuss methods of taking samples from this population,  designing studies that can best answer particular research questions.  We will also learn to identify the scope of inference for a study,  such as whether we can make causal versus correlational statements, and  when we can generalize our conclusions to the population at large.  We will also learn methods of exploratory data analysis  such as data visualizations and summary statistics.  And we will wrap up the unit with a light simulation-based  introduction to statistical inference.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
