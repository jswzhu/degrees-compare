TuitionOnline MPH tuition is approximately $46,000 for Michigan residents, $50,000 for out-of-state students. Tuition rates are based on an approximate estimate of 42 credits over 6 terms, the typical enrollment for students in this degree program. A student's tuition rate is determined by residency (ie. Michigan residents and non-Michigan residents). We offer competitive rates for both in-state and out-of-state students. Because the University of Michigan is partially state-funded, Michigan residents pay a lower tuition.Rates are subject to change and approval by the Regents of the University of Michigan.You wonât be billed upfront for the whole degree. Instead, youâll pay as you go: billed by semester based on the number of credits youâve enrolled in. If you need to take a term off, you won't be charged until you restart your courses. Payment processes are managed by the University of Michigan and its Office of the Registrar.The University of Michigan is committed to providing a world-class public health education to future leaders across the nation. 40% of students in the Fall 2019 online MPH cohort received scholarship funding from the School of Public Health.Financial ResourcesThe School of Public Health considers all admitted online MPH students for partial tuition scholarships funded by the school. Scholarship awards from the School of Public Health are based on both need and merit and provide finding for up to 25% of your total tuition costs. Consideration is based on your degree program application materials. You are not required to submit any additional application materials to be considered. Applicants who meet the priority application deadline are offered first consideration for funding.To learn more about financing your degree visit the Degrees Financial Resources Hub.Tuition ReimbursementMany of our students are currently employed and benefit from tuition reimbursement through their employers. If you need any documentation from the University of Michigan to support this process with your employer, please reach out to sph-inquiries@umich.edu (please include which program - Michigan's MPH or MS - you are interested in along with your inquiry).Payment PlansAll students are eligible for university payment plans that break up tuition into monthly payments: http://www.finance.umich.edu/finops/student/um-payment-plan.Student LoansStudent loans are available to fund your program costs. Like applicants to residential programs at the University of Michigan, we encourage applicants to our online Master of Public Health program to submit their FAFSA as soon as possible.
Submitting your FAFSA and designating the University of Michigan as a college of choice will allow our Office of Financial Aid to calculate a financial package if you are admitted.
