This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

DevOps process can be visualized as an infinite loop, comprising these steps: plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor. Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and communicate to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality. This course in the DevOps on AWS specialization focuses on code, build and test parts of the workflow. We will discuss topics such as source control, best practices for Continuous Integration, and how to use the right tools to measure code quality, by identifying workflow steps that could be automated.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnDevops, Test Automation, AWS cloudReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarHalf-Filled Star4.6 (139 ratings)5 stars72.66%4 stars19.42%3 stars7.19%1 star0.71%BMJan 22, 2023Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarIt is a really good course I have learned about aws cloud9, code build. code commit, and also aws SAMHelpful?MUNov 5, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarExcellent Course but much better if the instructor speak slowly and show the labs with details.Helpful?From the lessonWeek 2In the second week, you will discover why itâs important for teams to incorporate testing into the software development lifecycle at different stages of the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. You will get hands-on with AWS solutions by performing various application tests with AWS CodeBuild, automate your release process with AWS CodePipeline, and automate code deployments with AWS CodeDeploy.The Test7:55Exercise 2 Introduction1:33Automate Testing8:22Exercise 3 Introduction0:59Taught ByRafael LopesPrincipal Cloud TechnologistRussell SayersSenior Cloud TechnologistAlana LaytonTechnical Curriculum DeveloperTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Raf] It's time for Exercise 2.  In this exercise,  you will return to the AWS Cloud9 instance  and run the local build for the project.  The local build contains linting,  which is a static analysis of the code and unit tests.  Imagine the development team  of this project would use the local build scripts  to verify their code before doing a commit.  Next, you will run an integration test.  The integration test finds  the API Gateway WebSocket endpoint  and simulates a player completing a game.  This is the type of test we are using  to verify our deployments to a staging environment.  But, as always, there is plenty of room  for your own experimentation.  So think about what could be other implementations  for validating that.  Once you are happy with the tests, if the code looks good,  you will add a simple feature to the application  by making changes to the code.  For user experience purposes,  project managers realize that players are happier  with big scores.  So they asked if the game can give 20 points  for each correct answer instead of the original 10 points.  (electronic game music) (cheering)  Next, you will make changes to the code  and run the local build.  The unit's tests will fail.  This is expected because a functionality  of scoring was changed,  and the initial test is checking scores  as being incremented by 10.  When you fix up the unit tests and rerun the build,  you will see success, which is always a good indicator.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
