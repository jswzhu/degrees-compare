When you earn your MS-EE degree, you'll be able to:Pursue a new job, go after that promotion, or launch a career in electrical engineering.Keep pace with the rapid evolution of new technologiesApply foundational expertise and practical skills to solve real-world problemsWork effectively across disciplines like embedded systems, power electronics, photonics and optics, and moreEarn the same credentials on your diploma or transcript as the on-campus CU Boulder students.Program Overview & CurriculumThe MS-EE program and curriculum is built for flexibility. Choose from over 30 four-to-six week elective courses grouped into three focus areas:Power ElectronicsPower electronics is a key enabling technology in essentially all electronic systems and is increasingly important in the grid interface of renewable energy sources and in efficient electrical loads. The necessity for power electronics technology in these rapidly expanding areas creates an increasing need for design engineers equipped with knowledge and skills to actively participate in multidisciplinary teams.The MS-EE on Coursera's power curriculum addresses this demand for skilled power electronics design engineers, covering switching power supplies, DC-DC converters, inverters, power factor correction converters and LED lighting drivers. The power electronics curriculum emphasizes fundamentals and application in the power electronics field. This domain competency applies to end markets such as power management, portable power, computer systems, medical applications, spacecraft power systems, the automotive industry, renewable energy and the utilities.Embedded SystemsEmbedded system engineering is used in industries such as aerospace and defense, energy, industrial automation, health care, networking and communication, security, transportation and more. Embedded systems also drive the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling countless human-to-machine and machine-to-machine applications including home automation, security and more. The MS-EE on Coursera's Embedded Systems Engineering curriculum covers essential embedded technologies, synthesizes foundational principles, and directly applies them to current tools and trends. It is structured to provide you with a broad, versatile and highly competitive skill set. We emphasize practical, project-based learning across hardware and embedded software design that addresses numerous end markets, as well as multiple semiconductor technologies including sensors, controllers, programmable devices, and development tools.Photonics and OpticsLEDs will light households powered by photovoltaic panels and filled with displays and cameras communicating by optical fiber to distant owners wearing virtual reality glasses. Laser 3D printing will transform manufacturing. New microscopes and telescopes will peer into the depths of living cells and distant galaxies. The MS-EE on Coursera's photonics curriculum provides a firm theoretical foundation on the generation, modulation, radiative or guided transmission, sensing, and detection of optical signals. It also covers optical telecommunications, medical instrumentation, photovoltaic power generation, information processing, optical instruments, and environmental sensing. While some of these industries are mature, photonics continues to grow into new industries such as LED lighting and on-chip silicon photonics for multi-core CPUs.Try a non-credit course todayTest your abilities and practice required skills by taking a non-credit course first. You can upgrade later to a for-credit course and pay tuition to earn standalone credit, a graduate certificate, or the full MS-EE degree.Here are some courses you can start with:Active Optical DevicesDeveloping Industrial Internet of ThingsEmbedding Sensors and MotorsOptical EngineeringPower ElectronicsSemiconductor DevicesProgram LengthThe length of the program is dependent on what you're looking to accomplish.
