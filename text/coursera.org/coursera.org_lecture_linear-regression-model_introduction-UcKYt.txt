These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnStatistics, Linear Regression, R Programming, Regression AnalysisReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Star4.8 (1,634 ratings)5 stars80.23%4 stars16.03%3 stars2.93%2 stars0.24%1 star0.55%MMSep 26, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Starlinear regression is well taught throughout the course, but I think learning other types of regression modeling would be useful as well and adding them to the course materials is really good.Helpful?ANSep 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course is structured in a very informative way, it is easy to understand and at the same time difficult concepts are presented in a very easy way.

Many of you may be familiar with regression from reading the news, where graphs with straight lines are overlaid on scatterplots. Linear models can be used for prediction or to evaluate whether there is a linear relationship between two numerical variables.

So far in this class, we worked with a single numerical variable,  a single categorical variable.  We evaluated the relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable,  either testing for the difference between means or medians between two groups or  more than two groups.  Or, we also looked at the relationship between two categorical variables,  testing for the difference between two proportions between two groups or  more than two groups, as well.  In this unit,  we're going to consider the relationship between two numerical variables.  We're going to start our discussion by defining correlation as a measure  of the strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables.  We're then going to move on to modeling.  We're going to learn about model diagnostics.  In other words, checking for conditions for the model.  And we're also going to talk about inference based on a linear  regression model as well.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
