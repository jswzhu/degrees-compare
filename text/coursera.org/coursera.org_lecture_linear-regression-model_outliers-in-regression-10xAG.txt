These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnStatistics, Linear Regression, R Programming, Regression AnalysisReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Star4.8 (1,634 ratings)5 stars80.23%4 stars16.03%3 stars2.93%2 stars0.24%1 star0.55%MMSep 26, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Starlinear regression is well taught throughout the course, but I think learning other types of regression modeling would be useful as well and adding them to the course materials is really good.Helpful?ANSep 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course is structured in a very informative way, it is easy to understand and at the same time difficult concepts are presented in a very easy way.

We've talked about outliers numerous times throughout the course.  However, in this video, we're going to focus  on outliers within the context of linear regression.  And we're going to talk about how to identify various types  of outliers, as well as touch on how to handle them.  In this plot, we can see a cloud of points that are clustered together,  as well as one single point that is far away from the rest of them.  The question is how does this outlier influence the least squares line?  To answer this question, we want to think about where  the line would go if this particular outlier was not there.  And in that case, there would be  absolutely no relationship between the two variables,  because the pointer completely randomly scattered, so  the line would look like a horizontal line.  Therefore without the outlier, there is no relationship between x and  y, and this one single outlier makes it appear as though there is.  There are various types of outliers, and depending on  the type is how we decide how to handle them.  In general, outliers are points that fall away from the cloud of points.  Outliers that fall horizontally away from the center of the cloud but  don't influence the slope of the  regression line are called leverage points.  And outliers that actually influence the slope  of the regression line are called influential points.  Usually, these points are high leverage points.  And to determine if a point is influential, we want to  visualize the regression line with and without the point and ask...  Does this slope of the line change considerably?  So what type of an outlier is this?  To answer this question, we want to first ask, does this point  fall away from the rest of the data in the horizontal direction?  And the answer is yes, it does.  This makes it a potential leverage point.  But, another question we want to ask is, is it also influential?  Let's try to think about where the line would  go whether the point was there or not there.  It appears that the line would stay in exactly the same place.  So, the outlier point is actually on the trajectory of the regression line.  Therefore it does not influence it.  This makes this point a leverage point.  And what about this one?  Just like with the previous point, this outlying point also falls  away from the rest of the data in the horizontal direction.  So it could simply be a leverage point.  However, it also appears to be influencing the slope of the line.  If we were to remove this point, the line would look considerably different.  In fact, it would look horizontal since otherwise,  there's absolutely no relationship between x and y.  And therefore, we would identify this as an influential point.  When we are trying to decide whether to  leave this data point in the analysis or take  it out, if it's an influential point, we  want to be very careful about leaving it in there.  Because it's definitely going to affect our estimates and all of the decisions  that we're going to be making based on the results of the analysis.  Here's another example of influential points.  Here we have light intensity and surface temperature, both of  which are log of 47 stars in a star cluster.  We can see that there are two different types of stars, ones  that have a lower temperature and ones that have a higher temperature.  The solid blue line shows us how the regression  model would look if we were to ignore the outliers.  And the red dash line tells us how the regression  model would look if we were to include the outliers.  Those are the four stars with the lower temperatures.  Obviously, the red-dashed line is not a good fit for these data.  So in this case, what we might want to do is actually split our data into two, those  stars that have lower temperature and those stars that  have higher temperature, and model the two groups separately.  Remember, we don't want to just blindly get rid of outlying  points, because those actually might be the most interesting cases.  Perhaps these stars that are much colder than the  other ones are indeed more interesting to look at.  But what we want to do is we don't want to lump them along with the  stars that have a higher temperature and try to model all of them together.  [BLANK_AUDIO]  One last remark on influential points.  Let's take a look at this statement and evaluate whether it's true or false.  Influential points always reduce R squared.  It is true that influential points tend to make life more difficult.  But is it true that they always reduce R squared?  Let's take a look at these two graphs, one where  which we have an influential point and one where we don't.  The first plot does not have an influential point.  And we can see that the regression line looks fairly horizontal,  indicating that there's little to no relationship between x and y.  In the second plot, we have an influential point that is far away from the trajectory  of the original regression line, and hence pulls the regression line to itself.  In the first plot, the correlation coefficient is very low, just  0.08, and hence R squared is pretty low as well, at 0.0064.  In the second plot, however, all of a sudden, we're seeing an increase in  our correlation coefficient as well as an  increase associated with that in our R squared.  So, even though we would never want to fit a linear model in the second plot,  we are actually seeing a much higher correlation and a much higher R squared.  This is a good lesson for always viewing a scatter plot before fitting a model.  If we were simply deciding on whether or not the model  is a good fit by looking at the correlation coefficient and R  squared, we would never catch the anomaly in the data, and  that there is only one influential point that's driving the entire relationship.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
