You will learn how to prepare for the exam by exploring the examâs topic areas and how they map to SysOps Administration on AWS. You will review sample certification questions in each domain, practice skills with hands-on exercises, test your knowledge with practice question sets, and learn strategies for identifying incorrect responses by interpreting the concepts that are being tested in the exam. At the end of this course you will have all the knowledge and tools to help you identity your strengths and weaknesses in each certification domain areas that are being tested on the certification exam.

The AWS Certified SysOps Administrator â Associate (SOA-C02) exam is intended for system
administrators in a cloud operations role. The exam validates a candidateâs ability to deploy, manage, and
operate workloads on AWS and their ability to complete the following tasks: Support and maintain AWS workloads according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework, perform operations by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, implement security controls to meet compliance requirements, monitor, log, and troubleshoot systems, apply networking concepts (for example, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls), implement architectural requirements (for example, high availability, performance, capacity), perform business continuity and disaster recovery procedures and identify, classify, and remediate incidentsView SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCloud Computing Security, Software Deployment, AWS cloudFrom the lessonWeek 2Welcome to Week 2! This week, you will review relevant concepts and services for Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation (Domain 3) and Monitoring, Logging, and Remediation (Domain 1) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in these areas. Question walkthroughs for Domain 3 address the topics of provisioning and maintaining cloud resources, and automating manual or repeatable processes. For Domain 1, question walkthroughs cover using AWS monitoring and logging services, and remediating issues. In addition, this week features optional hands-on exercises for both domains so that you can practice your skills with creating a basic environment and automating with a monitoring solution. Accompanying video walkthroughs show one possible solution for addressing the requirements for each exercise.Introduction to Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation5:05Question Walkthrough: Provision and Maintain Cloud Resources6:45Lab Introduction: Creating a Basic Environment2:36Possible Lab Solution: Creating a Basic Environment8:05Understanding Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation3:11Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Seph] Deployment, provisioning, and automation  is one of my favorite areas within AWS.  The reason is, because when done well,  life becomes easier further down the road.  If you were to build an application architecture,  you could do it piece by piece,  working each component individually,  and you would get it done.  I've actually done that quite a bit.  On the other hand,  what if you used AWS CloudFormation?  What benefits would that provide?  Well, after learning how it operates,  you would be able to build the entire architecture  into a template.  This allows you to treat your infrastructure like code.  You could utilize reviews, versioning mechanisms,  enforce standards, and then deploy when  and where you need it.  Once deployed, you would be able to perform updates  to your architecture, changes,  and recover or duplicate as needed.  Whether testing updates, launching a failover environment,  or creating a recovery application,  you would know that they were all going to look  just like the template stated.  But what if you manage the systems within that architecture?  You could do parts of that with CloudFormation,  but you could also look at using a tool  like AWS Systems Manager.  That would enable you to perform actions  across groups of instances, running commands,  scheduling or configuring updates,  or making changes to the systems themselves.  Yes, you could do that by going  through each of the servers individually,  and that could work if you have a couple of servers,  or maybe a couple dozen.  But when you start getting to larger fleets of servers,  the job would become burdensome.  It also increases the chances for human error  to be introduced.  With codified updates, everything can be checked  and verified before anything is deployed.  Whereas with manual updates,  something as simple as an errant keystroke  could cause an issue.  And, as great as all of that stuff is,  those aren't my favorite parts about this topic.  What I think becomes the most valuable is the automation.  The ability to implement automated patch management,  updates, and various other automated tasks  means that you can perform necessary tasks  without all of the tedium and repetition.  Schedule your updates to your web and application servers  for when they're receiving minimal traffic,  and coordinate your log aggregation.  You could even automate the launch  of application architecture for only when you need it.  If you have a job that needs to run once a month  to organize, evaluate, and archive your logs,  the entire infrastructure could be automated  and would only launch when it was scheduled.  Understanding deployment, provisioning,  and automation can be a huge assistance  to your utilization of the AWS Cloud.  Hopefully, you can see some of the reasons  I like this area so much and how helpful your comprehension  of these topics will be to your real-world use of AWS.  And with that, I'll talk to you later.
