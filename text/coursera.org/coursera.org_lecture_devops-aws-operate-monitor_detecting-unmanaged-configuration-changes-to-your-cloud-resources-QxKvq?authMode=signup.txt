Monitoring and Operation are key aspects for both the release pipeline and production environments, because they provide instruments that help discover what's happening, as well as do modifications and enhancements on infrastructure that is currently running. 

This course teaches how to use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, as well as Amazon EventBridge and AWS Config for continuous compliance. It also covers Amazon CloudTrail and a little bit of Machine Learning for Monitoring operations!View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCI/CD, aws, DevopsReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarHalf-Filled Star4.6 (70 ratings)5 stars71.42%4 stars18.57%3 stars8.57%2 stars1.42%From the lessonWeek 2This week, you will start by learning about the importance of operation in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and discover how to detect unmanaged configuration changes to your cloud resources. Though this course focused on AWS solutions for DevOps operations and monitoring, you will also learn about third-party, open-source tooling that are well-known and widely used by the DevOps community. Lastly, you will get hands-on and run commands using AWS Systems Manager, and output logs to Amazon CloudWatch.Introduction to Week 2 - Operate1:47How to Prevent Hiccups at the End of the Infinite Loop4:06Detecting Unmanaged Configuration Changes to Your Cloud Resources3:28Taught ByRafael LopesPrincipal Cloud TechnologistAlana LaytonTechnical Curriculum DeveloperRussell SayersSenior Cloud TechnologistTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Raf] Imagine the following scenario:  You have an EC2 instance and two subnets that you create  via CloudFormation, subnet A and subnet B.  After creating the stack, you realize that you forgot  to add tags in the instance.  And let's say you go in the AWS Management Console  and add the tags.  In this case, tagging strategy is very important  because you are running a script that the security checks  only on instances marked with specific tags,  like environment = prod, which is the case here.  One week later,  you forgot that you manually added these tags  and decide to change that CloudFormation template  by doing a modification on the instance.  You'll now want to change the instance subnets  from subnet A to subnet B.  According to the CloudFormation documentation,  a subnet change requires a replacement of the resource.  You should always pay attention to updates  that require replacements because the current resource  will be deleted, and a new one will be created.  And guess what?  If you forgot to include in the template  the tags you manually added,  they won't be present in the new resource,  making your security checks not check that instance anymore.  I like to say that CloudFormation is jealous,  and you should not touch the resources it creates.  Avoid at all costs manually changing your infrastructure  once it was created by CloudFormation,  because if you want to change something in the template,  it may override what you have done manually.  It may get easier when you are the only one  modifying an infrastructure,  because you are more likely to remember what you did,  but it gets extremely challenging.  If you have multiple DevOps people  interacting with the environment.  Although the best practice is never manually touching  any environment created by CloudFormation,  if you have people having permission to do so,  trust me, they will.  And this is what we call CloudFormation drift.  Drifts happen when the environment gets changed  and CloudFormation is not aware of the change.  Drifts are not when you change the running code  with existing resources.  This is called a deployment.  Drifts happen when manual infrastructure configuration  changes are made, like tags, security groups,  instance types.  That's potentially dangerous for production environments  because sometimes, someone may have done  an undocumented action to apply a hotfix  on a Friday night, which may be overridden  by the next time you update the stack.  To get a little help from CloudFormation,  you can count on a feature called drift detection.  In the described scenario,  if I had changed the tags, running CloudFormation  drift detection for the EC2 resource would point out to me  that the current tags of the instance  do not match the tags that CloudFormation  was instructed to create.  You should pay special attention to these drifts,  especially if the change you want to do  via CloudFormation requires a replacement of the resource,  and especially if that resource contains data  from your users.  The easiest way to avoid drifts and be safer here,  is not manually changing  whatever was created via CloudFormation,  and it should be a best practice to incorporate  drift detection as part of your CI/CD build process,  since everything here can and  should be done, programmatically.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
