The World Economic Forum states the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) could create 58 million net new jobs in the next few years, yet itâs estimated that currently there are 300,000 AI engineers worldwide, but millions are needed. This means there is a unique and immediate opportunity for you to get started with learning the essential ML concepts that are used to build AI applications â no matter what your skill levels are. Learning the foundations of ML now, will help you keep pace with this growth, expand your skills and even help advance your career.

I'm Scott Gilbert  with AWS Training and Certification.  Welcome to Amazon Rekognition.  In this video, we will discuss Rekognition,  part of Amazon's machine learning offerings.  I will highlight how easy it is to get started with  Rekognition as well as give  an introduction to its programmatic use.  I've been with AWS for just under two years and I'm  currently responsible for delivering  training across North America.  As part of the training team,  I've contributed to delivering classes as well  as assisting in the creation of new content.  Rekognition is one of  AWS's offerings in artificial intelligence.  Rekognition allows you to easily analyze images.  Your applications can make calls to  Rekognition allowing you to recognize faces,  landscapes, and even the mood of a person.  In this video, I will introduce  to you the service Rekognition.  I will talk to you about the benefits of the service as  well as go through the key features of Rekognition.  I will step through a couple of use cases of Rekognition,  highlighting just how powerful the service can be.  I will end this presentation with  a quick demonstration of the service,  and I hope to have you logging into  AWS to use this as well.  The main benefits of Rekognition are it's  ease of use as well as its low cost.  With zero experienced in developing machine learning,  you can load an image into  Rekognition and it will be analyzed automatically.  You can take advantage of the APIs  we've created to automate this analysis.  Best of all, as a managed service,  Amazon will handle auto-scaling  of Rekognition allowing you to  potentially send thousands of images  an hour for analysis through recognition.  The key features of Rekognition  are object detection where  the engine is able to accurately  determine what isn't an image,  facial analysis, facial comparison,  as well as facial recognition.  The Engine is able to determine mood,  the number of faces,  as well as differentiating  different faces from each other.  All processed images give you a confidence score,  giving you the ability to drop low confidence processes  or perhaps flag them for secondary or even manual review.  Let's look at a few use cases for recognition.  Here, I hope to showcase just how useful  and powerful the service can be for your applications.  Searchable image libraries can be useful for  many cases such as  real estate agent looking to  take a picture of properties.  They can then upload these images to an S3 bucket.  This upload automatically triggers a lambda function.  The Lambda function calls Rekognition  which pulls the image from the S3 bucket,  and analyze this image and returns the image and  labels along with the confidence scores for  each label into Elastic Search.  Users can now search  through the labels to find the images.  This makes searching for keywords such as a garage or  yard far far easier for any real estate application.  Another use case would be image moderation.  This functionality can greatly assist foreign moderators  ensuring that inappropriate content is not posted.  As a user uploads an image,  the object upload triggers a lambda function.  Lambda calls Rekognition which  examines the image for the content.  If there is no inappropriate content found,  the picture is immediately posted and viewable by users.  If there is inappropriate content detected,  the post is either rejected and  the image is removed from storage.  If the confidence scores are not high enough,  either way it can also send the image for  manual review ensuring that  only approved content is shown.  Sentiment analysis can be quite useful for many users.  From retailers wanting to track the effectiveness of  sales or demographic information of the shoppers,  to a company that just wants to  ensure that their workforce is happy.  Live images are captured via  On-premise camera or user uploaded image.  The application will send  the images to Rekognition for our analysis.  The app stores the information in S3 and  Redshift will allow them to receive this data in.  Quick site can then be used for  regular analysis of the information,  tracking the sentiment over time.  All information can then be placed into  a weekly or monthly or even quarterly marketing report  to track the effectiveness of your ongoing sales,  upgrades to the stores,  or just changes in your overall merchandise over time.  I'm now going to step through  the Rekognition engine on AWS.  I hope to highlight just how easy this is to use.  So I've logged into the management console.  Let's go ahead and load up the Rekognition service.  If you've recently visited the Engine,  you will see it here in your recently visited Services.  Otherwise, you can click on  services and open up the Rekognition Engine.  You can access Rekognition programmatically and  use it's APIs to analyze your images.  You can download the SDK and run  your programs or write programs that utilize Rekognition.  I'm just going to try the demo to Rekognition to  highlight just how easy it is to analyze your images.  As we pull up Rekognition,  we have some stock images  that are already loaded into this.  On the right, it will show the results.  You have the labels as well as  the confidence score for each label.  There is, in fact, a skateboard,  there's people in this image,  and there's cars parked on the side of the road.  We want to expand this a little bit more.  We see automobiles, vehicle, intersection.  It is in fact on a road all the way  down to it's in a metropolis,  there's SUVs and apartments.  This is a stock image.  Let's go ahead and try to upload our own.  Click on the "Upload" button and select an image.  Now, this is an image of Seattle.  Our labels found are architecture, city,  downtown, high rise, skyscraper,  as well as Metropolis.  We have confidence scores for all of these labels.  This is, in fact, a architecture is shown in a city.  It is downtown. There are multiple high rises.  It is, in fact, in a Metropolis.  This image is fairly easy.  Let's look at another image.  This is multiple people in here.  We have people, humans, clothing, overcoat.  We want to go through facial analysis.  In this image, we are detecting  a face from the rest of the image.  We want to load in.  It is able to pull and highlight where the faces are.  Let's see if any of these people are celebrities.  Well, I know this person is a celebrity.  Let's go back to our old image.  But unfortunately, none of  the people in this image are celebrities.  So as you can see,  Rekognition is quite easy to use.  There are multiple tools  multiple demos that are available.  I really hope that you log on and try to play  around with different images  and the analysis of the images.  In summary, Rekognition is  a great tool in our machine learning offerings.  Rekognition gives you the ability to  run multiple forms of analysis on  your images and returns labels with  confidence scores to ensure the analysis is accurate.  I hope you've learned a little something and we'll  continue to explore our other videos.  I'm Scott Gilbert, with  AWS Training and Certification.
