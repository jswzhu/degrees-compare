It can be divided in to several short videos. Seeing a long video is creating a boredom. Otherwise it is a very nice course.Helpful?ANApr 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course materials and lecture delivery was just one of a kind,I have learnt a complete skill on Machine Learning and its Algorithms.I hope this will lead me towards a next level of Data science.Helpful?See all 5 star reviewsFilter by:All LearnersChevron DownAll StarsChevron DownSort by:  Most HelpfulChevron Down1376 - 1400 of 1,512 Reviews for Getting Started with AWS Machine LearningFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Andrew Aâ¢May 16, 2020The course is good for an overview Machine Learning in AWS, with examples of use cases, and how the AWS ecosystem can be utilised. There are not a lot of practical tasks, with hands on projects however, which would improve the course substantially, if possible.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Gazal Gâ¢Jun 20, 2020It was a decent course that gave an overview of the AWS and its components. AWS has all the solution to make an efficient and scalable ML/DL solutions.  It would be better it had an online lab or embedded environment to do hands-on. Thank youThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Renzo M C Dâ¢May 16, 2020I gave a three stars review for it is somewhat good for beginners by introducing Amazon's machine learning softwares and their features. It can be useful but not likely useful for those who are trying to learn machine learning from scratch.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Yasar Bâ¢Oct 1, 2020Informative? Definitely. But more importantly, it felt like an extended advertising campaign for amazon services. However, it was helpful as you learn the basics of machine learning and also their implementation through various examples,This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy URK17CS085 J S L Aâ¢Apr 5, 2020Some Practical teaching of how code works is not good enough. We want practical from the basics. Sometimes it starts from where and ends somewhere. Please make it more convenient to study.But in overall it was Good This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy RLeeâ¢Mar 30, 2022not just showing codes, but labs to exercise those codes, esp those with complex architecture, like setting up Amazon Lambda to trigger calculations from backend Amazon Sagemaker and store the outputs in S3 etc. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Manoj K Kâ¢Aug 16, 2020Course is not hands-on. It is a compilation of Amazon Web Services available for ML. In this course you will not learn machine learning. You will learn different AWS services in a passive way. Not woth buying. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Michelleâ¢May 13, 2020Class tends to focus more on memorizing charts than really giving me more practical AI knowledge. Also... why are so many of the lecturers speaking in monotone voices? Trying showing more enthusiasm, please! This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Rafael Pâ¢Oct 23, 2019Although it is an introductory course to ML on AWS, the videos are extremely long and causes attention to be lost after 10 minutes. My opinion is that they should try to put videos between 5 to 10 minutes.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Jackie Lâ¢Jun 10, 2020Lots of repetition at the beginning of early machine learning concepts. A bit difficult to follow on some later topics. Would be nice if there were easy to access github and AWS links on the page.

Also, the whole thing felt more like an Amazon advertisement rather than an Educational Source.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Raul D Mâ¢Mar 7, 2020It is an introduction to AI-based solutions on AWS. Sagemaker is discussed only in the last week. It would be interesting a more detailed course about SageMaker with some practice-lab. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Naveen Aâ¢Oct 30, 2019The material was good.  Some redundancy between videos but that is ok.  The biggest problem was the quizzes.  They do not align with the video and don't seem to score correctly.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Ronnie Gâ¢Jun 18, 2020Although informational and intensive, it is very difficult to keep up with the later weeks when Amazon products are introduced with the lack of hands on experience on Coursera. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Akshay Sâ¢Apr 30, 2020This course is good for overview only. They didn't include any single programming exercise plus they talk too much about features and they didn't discuss any drawbacks.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy shailâ¢Jul 11, 2020This is long theory and regarding AWS products. I liked one hour practical video on SageMaker

 by Denis Batalov in week 5, hoping to practice based on his lesson.


This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Gonzalo C Lâ¢May 16, 2020Some parts are great, with lot of detail. But some courses are more focused on let us know which features to buy and use. I was more interesting in how they workedThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy vivek mâ¢Jun 26, 2020Its more of an advertisement for the machine learning tools provided by amazon web services than a course, but we can find some useful bits and pieces about ML.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Abjeet Sâ¢Jul 22, 2020It's a good course only for introduction to various amazon utilities which are extremely useful for machine learning. But as said before, Just an introduction!This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Dagart Aâ¢Nov 29, 2021Not very hands-on and it was out-dated. The SageMaker Image Classification notebook does not run properly with the new configuration of SageMaker.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Tavi Câ¢Jul 12, 2020There is a lot of marketing and NO CODE at all. Anyway, as a ML developer I found it interesting and it helped me to understand some principlesThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Pranav Mâ¢May 19, 2020This course is made for people who work for Amazon! The course is not difficult at all. The quizzes could have been much difficult. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Jojo Aâ¢May 8, 2020Largely an Amazon Sagemaker product intro, requires intermediate to significant level of ML background to fully appreciate.  This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Karishma Câ¢May 16, 2020Nice details understanding and practical life approach learning.More lab exercise would be good for hands-on experience.This is helpful Chevron Left 1 ... 51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61 Chevron Right
