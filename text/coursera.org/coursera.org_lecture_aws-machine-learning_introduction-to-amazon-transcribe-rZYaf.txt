I'm Patty Raymond for  Amazon Web Services, Training and Certification.  For the next few minutes,  I'm going to walk you through a quick overview  of Amazon Transcribe.  Amazon Transcribe is  an automatic speech recognition service  also known as ASR,  that's designed to make it  easy for developers to incorporate  speech-to-text capabilities into their applications.  In this course, I'll highlight  the features of Amazon Transcribe,  talk a bit about how it works,  and provide a few examples of common use cases.  I'll also tell you how to get  started and give a quick demonstration.  Historically, people saved most data in  structured formats that were relatively easy to search.  For example, information entered  into databases via forms or  saved and spreadsheets is pretty easy  to analyze even at very high volumes.  Increasingly, we capture data in  less structured formats that are more  difficult to analyze on a large scale.  In particular, the speech in audio and video files needs  to be recorded as text  before it can be searched or categorized.  Traditionally, converting audio content  to text has required a lot of human intervention.  Someone has to play back the recording and capture all of  the speaker's words in text form and then  review and edit the transcribed content.  Even with the benefit of a speech-to-text tool,  a lot of editing and formatting is required.  This is particularly true for outputs that require  high levels of accuracy and  readability like video subtitles.  The high level of effort to manually  convert these media to text means that only  the most critical items are transcribed and  valuable information may be overlooked.  Amazon Transcribe can help  you address these potential barriers.  Amazon Transcribe is  a fully managed and continually trained ASR service  that accepts common audio formats including WAV,  MP3, MP4, and FLAC,  and can accurately transcribe  both low fidelity and high fidelity audio.  This makes it a natural fit for  use cases such as transcribing customer  service calls into analyzable data or  generating subtitles for videos  with a high level of accuracy.  Amazon Transcribe uses deep learning to  provide accurate and quick transcriptions.  It was designed to make it easy for you to get  even greater accuracy and  usefulness from the transcribed output.  For example, the output is  not just one long uninterrupted string of text.  Instead, Amazon Transcribe uses machine  learning to add in  punctuation and grammatical formatting.  So the texts you get back is immediately usable.  Amazon Transcribe also timestamps every word,  which makes it easy to align  subtitles for close captioning.  It also makes it easy to index.  Transcripts include confidence levels  for each word of the transcribed output,  making it easy to determine where  more editing or quality assurance may be required.  Amazon Transcribe also helps you mitigate  issues with source audio to improve accuracy.  For example, you can upload  custom vocabulary that can help improve  the accuracy if the content you're transcribing has  industry-specific terms like medical or legal terms.  You can choose the language of the source file.  The supported languages are listed,  and Amazon Transcribe attribute speech to  different speakers to make it  easier to interpret the output.  Because Amazon Transcribe was  designed to be easy for developers to use,  there are only a few steps to get started.  You don't need to understand how the underlying models  work and you don't need to  build your own machine learning models.  You invoke the service via  API and with a few lines of code,  you're ready to transcribe files on Amazon S3.  You can easily initiate the transcription operation via  the AWS management console  and you can test the service via the console too.  Amazon Transcribe offers secure communication  between the service and  your applications through SSL encryption.  You can access your transcriptions via assigned URLs.  You can also make sure that information is  kept secure and confidential by  controlling access to Amazon Transcribe  through AWS IAM policies.  The service integrates easily with  other AWS services such as Amazon Comprehend,  Amazon ES, Amazon Translate, and Amazon Athena.  You can easily leverage  powerful deep learning models combined with  highly scalable index searching and analysis tools  to reap high-value from your audio and video content.  Here are a few examples.  A call center uses Amazon Transcribe to produce  transcriptions of low-fidelity phone calls  with high accuracy.  The center uses Amazon Comprehend  on the transcribed data to  identify key phrases and  customer sentiments so that they can classify the calls.  They use Amazon Athena to query the data and  Amazon QuickSight to visualize  the results and analyze trends.  The Human Resources Department uses  Amazon Transcribe to generate  transcriptions of meetings and training sessions,  then indexes the results using Amazon ES.  Internal stakeholders can quickly search for  content on demand to locate topics of interest.  A video production business uses  Amazon Transcribe to produce  transcriptions of audio tracks for subtitles.  Limited editing is done on the output files and  the quality assurance team can focus  on sections that have lower confidence ratings.  Using the timestamps in the transcript file,  they can easily align the captions with the video.  They use Amazon Translate to convert  the transcript into additional languages.  You can even translate conversations.  Use Amazon Transcribe to  generate the transcription of the speaker's message.  Use Amazon Comprehend to  recognize the language of the speaker,  and use Amazon Translate to translate  the message into the receiver's language.  Then, use Amazon Polly to  read the translated message to the recipient.  To get started, you'll need to  save the file you want to transcribe on  Amazon S3 stored in a bucket with the proper permissions.  The files must be in one of four formats; FLAC, MP3,  MP4, or WAV, and they must be less than two hours long.  For best results, source files  should use lossless compression,  FLAC or WAV, and recording  should be done in a low-noise environment.  You'll want to limit crosstalk too.  You'll need an AWS account with  an IAM user who has  full access to the transcribed API calls,  and you should be familiar with the CLI.  You'll also need a text editor.  We also recommend that you  review the developer's guide which you can  find in the AWS documentation under Amazon Transcribe.  For the demonstration, I'll use  the AWS management console to start a job,  verify that it's completed,  and then review the results.  On the AWS management console,  select "Amazon Transcribe."  Then click the "Try Amazon Transcribe" button  to open the "Create Transcription Job" dialogue.  Give your job a relevant name.  For this demonstration, I'm going to  use Gettysburg Address test.  Paste or type the location of the source file  on Amazon S3 that you want to transcribe.  Select the source language.  For this demonstration, I'll use English,  and select the format of your source file.  For this example, it's MP3.  Optionally, I can specify the media sampling rate.  This rate must match  the sampling rate of the associated media content.  Sampling rates between 8000 hertz and  48,000 hertz are supported by Amazon Transcribe.  Once I fill that in,  I click the "Create" button and  my job has been submitted for processing.  Once the request has been submitted,  I can check the status of the job by  selecting "Transcription Jobs" from the menu on the left.  This opens a list of available jobs.  You may see older transcripts.  That's because the service makes  transcription results available for 90 days.  In the status column,  I can see that my job is in progress.  If I click on the job name itself,  I can review the details of the job and also review  or copy the sample JSON request for this job.  When the status of the job is completed,  I'll be able to select the output URL from  the job details page and review the transcribed text.  The output file is placed in  an S3 bucket and is only accessible with assigned URI.  For added security, the URI is valid for  only a few minutes after you  initially request the job results.  Just taking a quick look at the transcript,  I can see that the content of my MP3 file has been  transcribed with formatting and punctuation,  and I can see the timestamps and  confidence levels for each word in the file.  In summary, Amazon Transcribe is  a fully managed and continually  trained ASR service that is  designed to make it easy for developers to incorporate  accurate speech-to-text capabilities  into their applications.  I hope you found this introduction  to Amazon Transcribe helpful,  and that you're ready to try it yourself.  Please continue to explore other related courses.
