This course focuses on clinical trials, the value of applying discoveries to clinical practice, and best practices for conducting research. Youâll see examples of human subjects research through clinical trials that have been translated into practice and, later, into basic scientific discoveries. Youâll also discuss the role of the federal government in supporting and regulating translational research conducted on humans.

This is the third course of five in the âTranslational Scienceâ series.View SyllabusFrom the lessonWeek 1Welcome to Week 1 of Translating Research to Patients. This week you will learn to 1) describe the four types of clinical trials research and the purpose for each type, and 2) define human subjects research and describe its purpose in the ethical conduct of translational research.

In fact, the development of new medicines, medical devices and treatments couldn't  happen without the people who volunteer as participants in clinical trials.  The information that researchers learn from this type of study  provides firsthand scientific evidence for the advice and  treatments that doctors give to their patients.  So what is a clinical trial?  It's a research study in which human subjects are prospectively assigned to one  or more interventions to evaluate the effects of those interventions on  health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.  That seems complicated.  So let's explore what it means.  First, the term prospectively assigned means that a predefined process is used  to assign research participants to one or more parts of the clinical trial.  This could be the intervention, a placebo or a control group.  Randomization is one example of prospective assignment.  An intervention is a systematic activity where researchers change something about  the research participants or their environment to measure the effectiveness  of a treatment or health service.  Examples of intervention studies can include therapeutic trials where people  are given a treatment for a specific condition to improve their health.  Preventive trials for healthy people that examine the effect of behavior like  diet or exercise or treatments like vaccines and preventive trials for  people who are at-risk for developing certain diseases or conditions.  A health related biomedical or behavioral outcome refers to the change in health  status as a result of the research intervention.  Simply put it's the effect the treatment has on a person's health.  There are many types of clinical research study designs.  We often hear the term randomized controlled trial or  RCT when talking about clinical trials.  Randomized means that participants are assigned by chance alone to receive one or  more treatments or interventions that are being studied.  One of these study groups is called the control.  It's used as a comparison for the treatment or  intervention that's being studied.  A control might be a standard practice, a placebo or  sugar pill or even no intervention at all.  Clinical trials can also include other types of study designs,  such as parallel groups, where each participant receives only one of  the interventions being studied or a cross over design where each participant  receives all of the interventions being studied one after the other.  Clinical trials are often conducted in IV phases.  Each one has a different purpose to help answer different research questions.  Phase I trials are used in small groups of people to test an experimental medicine or  treatment for the first time.  Researchers will look for possible toxic side effects of the treatment and  determine a safe dose.  In Phase II clinical trials, the experimental medicine or  treatment is given to a larger group of people to determine if it's effective and  to do more testing for toxic side effects.  During Phase III clinical trials, the study, medicine or  treatment is given to very large groups of people.  This type of study is a full scale evaluation and  is often conducted as a randomized controlled trial.  Researchers confirm the effectiveness of the treatment monitor for side effects,  compare it to other commonly used treatments and  collect information about safety.  Phase IV clinical trials are conducted after the medicine or  treatment has been approved for use.  This type of observational study continues to monitor for side effects and  provides researchers with more information about the treatments, risks and benefits.  Today, clinical trials are the primary way for researchers to test new treatments and  discover new ways to diagnose and prevent disease.
