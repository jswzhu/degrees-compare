About the Program Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, Professor & Dean, Jindal School of International AffairsPlay videoApplication ProcessDevika Misra, Assistant Professor of Practice, Jindal School of International AffairsPlay videoStudent SuccessDevika Misra, Assistant Professor of Practice, Jindal School of International AffairsPlay videoStudent Testimonial Abdihakim Abdi, Class of Fall 2021Play videoOpting for this programme was a no-brainer for a foreign policy wonk like me. The curriculum entails an in-depth study of various aspects of foreign and security policy like Diplomacy, Intelligence, War, Weapon Systems, Counter-terrorism and Conflict Resolution- at a time when most Interntional Relations degrees in India focus on conventional theory and area studies. In addition to a fantastic curriculum, MAIRSS also features a stellar faculty. But what makes the programme truly special is its multi-national virtual classroom, which allows us to build relationships around the globe. Our cohort consists of students from diverse professional backgrounds including diplomats, military officials, business people, full-time students, among others. This makes for an extremely rich learning environment.Raghav Dua, Class of Spring 2022, Delhi, IndiaAs a busy professional and a father of four, I was seeking a graduate program that offered flexibility, but was stimulating and educationally sound. The M.A. International Relations, Security, and Strategy program is structured in a way that allows me to fit it into my schedule, but the rigor is not lost. The instructors are passionate and informed, and the support from the school is excellent. I would encourage anybody looking for a high quality, cost-effective education to consider JGU and this program.Michael Needham (Age 56), Class of Fall 2021, New York, USAStudent ExperienceThis programme is a fully online degree programme taught via the Coursera learning platform, so  you can create a schedule that works around commitments like employment, family, hobbies, and more.
