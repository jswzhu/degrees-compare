Martin is currently Academic Member of the Digital Environment Research Institute and Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute. Before becoming a lecturer, he was a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Research Fellow and a Fellow of the Isaac Newton Trust. His expertise is the theoretical and computational handling of inverse & ill-posed problems, with particular focus on the fusion of model-based and data-driven regularisation approaches. Prof Boris KhoruzhenkoProfessor of MathematicsBoris obtained a Diploma in Mathematics from V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University and his PhD in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics from the Institute for Low Temperature Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. He worked for 12 years as a Research Fellow in the Mathematical Division at the Institute for Low Temperature Physics before joining Queen Mary University of London in 1996. His current research interests are in the Random Matrix Theory and its applications. This involves investigating patterns in distribution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of random matrices and operators.Dr Arthur GuillauminLecturer in Mathematical Data ScienceArthur pursued a PhD under the supervision of Pr Sofia C. Olhede and Dr Adam M. Sykulski, at the Department of Statistical Science of University College London. He then held a postdoctoral position for two years with the same supervisors, following which he moved to a postdoctoral position at New York University under the supervision of Pr Laure Zanna. His research interests are in modelling spatio-temporal data with a focus on applications to environmental sciences.MSc Applied Data Analytics events:August 9, 2022MSc Applied Data Analytics Webinar: QMUL Alumni and Careers | Sign up to attendMay 31, 2022MSc Applied Data Analytics Webinar: Q&A with Dr Primoz Skraba | Watch the webinar hereCoursera does not grant credit, and does not represent that any institution other than the degree granting institution will recognise the credit or credential awarded by the institution; the decision to grant, accept, or transfer credit is subject to the sole and absolute discretion of an educational institution.
