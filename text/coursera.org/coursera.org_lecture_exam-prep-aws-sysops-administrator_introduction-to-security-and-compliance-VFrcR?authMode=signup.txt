You will learn how to prepare for the exam by exploring the examâs topic areas and how they map to SysOps Administration on AWS. You will review sample certification questions in each domain, practice skills with hands-on exercises, test your knowledge with practice question sets, and learn strategies for identifying incorrect responses by interpreting the concepts that are being tested in the exam. At the end of this course you will have all the knowledge and tools to help you identity your strengths and weaknesses in each certification domain areas that are being tested on the certification exam.

The AWS Certified SysOps Administrator â Associate (SOA-C02) exam is intended for system
administrators in a cloud operations role. The exam validates a candidateâs ability to deploy, manage, and
operate workloads on AWS and their ability to complete the following tasks: Support and maintain AWS workloads according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework, perform operations by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, implement security controls to meet compliance requirements, monitor, log, and troubleshoot systems, apply networking concepts (for example, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls), implement architectural requirements (for example, high availability, performance, capacity), perform business continuity and disaster recovery procedures and identify, classify, and remediate incidentsView SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCloud Computing Security, Software Deployment, AWS cloudFrom the lessonWeek 4Welcome to Week 4! This week, you will review relevant concepts and services for on Security and Compliance (Domain 4) and Cost and Performance Optimization (Domain 6) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in these areas. The Domain 4 question walkthroughs cover data and infrastructure protection, and security and compliance policies. For Domain 6, the question walkthroughs focus on cost-optimization strategies and performance-optimization strategies. This week also includes a practice assessment that includes questions from all exam domains.Introduction to Security and Compliance5:14Question Walkthrough: Data and Infrastructure Protection9:17Understanding Security and Compliance4:36Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Blaine] Welcome back.  There are six domains,  each with a different focus, that together make up  the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator exam.  Let's take a look at the Security and Compliance domain,  which accounts for 16 percent of the total score.  Remember, you can design the most-resilient architecture,  but if you don't protect it from all enemies,  both foreign and domestic, then we haven't finished our job.  And security is not a single subject  or single-solution conversation.  AWS recommends a security-in-depth, best-practice approach,  which means this exam is following that pattern.  So everything from user management, network controls,  data classification methodologies,  encryption, encryption at rest and in transit.  And speaking of encryption,  how do you manage your encryption keys  and securely store other secrets?  There are two subdomains  with Security and Compliance.  Implement and manage security and compliance policies.  Implement data and infrastructure protection strategies.  All right, let's break them down.  First, implement and manage security and compliance policies  starts with IAM, Identity and Access Management.  And there's a lot of details to think  about in those three letters.  What password policies are the best for certain scenarios?  What about requiring MFA?  Know the differences between users, groups, roles  and the associated policy documents.  And speaking to policy documents, consider resource policies  to be absolutely in play here, along  with finer details about those policies, such as conditions.  Now, you should be able to look at the JSON of an IAM policy  and be able to interpret what it is actually allowing,  or perhaps denying.  This subdomain also explores  validating policies and permissions.  Also, troubleshooting and auditing access issues,  which would include services like CloudTrail,  obviously, but also loops in objects  like the IAM Access Analyzer  and the IAM Policy Simulator.  You should understand how Trusted Advisor works,  and which security controls it observes.  Multi-account strategies are in play,  which means you should be comfortable  with AWS Control Tower,  and absolutely know the moving parts with AWS Organizations.  Finally, multi-Region strategies  might be a concern for compliance.  So the exam will see if you can validate your Region  and service selection.  No, the exam will not ask you to be an expert  in a particular compliance structure,  like GDPR or PCI,  but you may be presented  with an unnamed compliance requirement,  such as, for compliance reasons,  your user data is required to be encrypted  at rest and reside inside German borders,  how do you achieve compliance?  Now, that you'd need to be able to answer.  The second domain is implement data  and infrastructure protection strategies.  As we dive into data protection, we start  by being able to implement a data classification scheme.  How do we identify which data needs to be locked down,  and what data is publicly available?  Once you can identify what needs to be locked down,  well, then, lock it down.  (chuckles)  Encryption.  Managing encryption keys with native options  available in S3, and other services.  Also, understand how KMS  and CloudHSM work to enable encryption-at-rest strategies.  For encryption in transit, understand your encryption  termination options, how to leverage VPN  and AWS Certificate Manager.  Other secrets may need to be managed  by the appropriately named  AWS Secrets Manager.  And people say our names are weird.  Also, in that category,  don't forget to review the Systems Manager Parameter Store.  Finally, protection schemes that are not reviewed,  observed, and reported are just wish lists.  So, be familiar with the full range  of security-assisting services like AWS Config,  GuardDuty, Security Hub, Inspector, Amazon Macie.  Know where each one contributes to a comprehensive view  of your current posture.  Those are the subjects in play for Security and Compliance.  Keep it secret, keep it safe.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
