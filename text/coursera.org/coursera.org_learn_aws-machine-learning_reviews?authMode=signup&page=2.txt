The World Economic Forum states the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) could create 58 million net new jobs in the next few years, yet itâs estimated that currently there are 300,000 AI engineers worldwide, but millions are needed. This means there is a unique and immediate opportunity for you to get started with learning the essential ML concepts that are used to build AI applications â no matter what your skill levels are. Learning the foundations of ML now, will help you keep pace with this growth, expand your skills and even help advance your career.

It can be divided in to several short videos. Seeing a long video is creating a boredom. Otherwise it is a very nice course.Helpful?ANApr 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course materials and lecture delivery was just one of a kind,I have learnt a complete skill on Machine Learning and its Algorithms.I hope this will lead me towards a next level of Data science.Helpful?See all 5 star reviewsFilter by:All LearnersChevron DownAll StarsChevron DownSort by:  Most HelpfulChevron Down26 - 50 of 1,512 Reviews for Getting Started with AWS Machine LearningFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Suresh C Pâ¢May 4, 2020Thank you Coursera ! i have  enjoy your E-learning programe i think some topic very dificult for me and i can't undestand some topic. i hope i will start again and review again all module.This is helpful (2)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy galimbaâ¢Jun 4, 2020I would have expected Amazon to actually provide us with some hands-on experience. To tell you the truth, I've learned nothing by completing this course. Thank god I didn't have to pay for this, otherwise I'd be really pissed off.This is helpful (2)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Gustavo A Mâ¢May 9, 2020No exercises (I've learned more from hands-on practice at my job).This course is just a bunch of random youtube videos put together, just AWS ads.SorryThis is helpful (2)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Rohan Dâ¢Aug 17, 2020The course isn't introductory at all. It requires a lot of prior understanding of Machine Learning algorithms.This is helpful (2)Filled StarStarStarStarStarBy Ulrich Râ¢Apr 23, 2020Nothing to learn here.

I really enjoyed all the information, thanks to all who are willing to share the knowledge.  I'm ready to tackle the next course of AWS ML. This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Sofia Sâ¢Dec 7, 2019It's a practical easy to follow introductory course of AWS machine learning with Sagemaker. I'm looking forward to learning more about Sagemaker and get some practical experience.This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy Xinlei Xâ¢Sep 2, 2020The first two weeks are a good place to get the basic AI knowledges; week 3-5 are basically amazon ads, and you'd better look elsewhere for actual aws tutorials.This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarBy shubham sâ¢Feb 10, 2022excellent course for starterThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Carlos Câ¢Aug 18, 2020The course is overall a great experience with AWS ML and AI offerings however I feel like most AWS courses it really focuses on selling you on the products and services versus explaining how they work.  Week 02 could use some more time on explaining the Bias-Variance Tradeoff and the different basic formulas to the Confusion Matrix . This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Khoo K Câ¢Jul 17, 2020Week 1 and week 2 are awesome, very informative whereas start from week 3 until week 5, is quite confusing because there are number of tools, and I'm not sure whether in which stage I should use them, perhaps in future, prepare the lectures according the flow of use of the tools, so that we can have better understandingThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Jagruti Pâ¢Sep 26, 2020The course was really very informative and  a brief explanation of how to use Amazon Cloud Services for machine learning starting from ground truth annotations to deployment. Only one thing, had the long videos being fragmented into shorter videos, it could have been better.This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Alison Lâ¢Nov 11, 2020Better understanding on use cases for each ML services after a brief demonstration, but would suggest featuring coding steps to achieve a use case that would otherwise be lengthy and cumbersome to self-execute from reading AWS blogs and documentation.This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Jurgen Sâ¢Oct 5, 2019Good overview of ML with some deep technical sections as wellThis is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Swarup Sâ¢Jun 12, 2021For students there should not be a compulsion of entering credit card details to freely use AWS and practice it, I don't have a card to enter details about, i could not get the hands-on experience on AWS applications that are demonstrated in the course. And this course can also be improved by assigning only one best teacher to teach, it is very confusing, hearing from different persons with their different perspectives. I suggest there should be around 3 instructors only, so that they progressively teach us with their unique perspective of the topic.This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Rony Aâ¢May 19, 2020Week 5 encompasses the content of the entire course and does it well. Weeks 1-4 contain endless repetitions and too many promotions. The total experience was therefore adversely affected (for me). The repetitions were downright annoying. Not what I've come to expect after many courses on Coursera that were first rate. Still, week 5 was spot-on. I can appreciate that this was a free course, but I would have preferred a paid course that had hands-on exercises and more thorough exams.This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Munawar P Vâ¢Sep 24, 2019A fair start to an overview of machine learning and aws services with hands-on exercise. There is lot of space for improvements on course and quiz contents (Some videos and quiz options are duplicated). Rather than an end quiz, few quizzes in between the long videos would ab better. A hands-on project for completion assessment can also be included. Recommendation rating for healthcare professionals (myself being one): 2.8/5 (where 0= never recommend , 5= highly recommend) This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy David Bâ¢Jul 29, 2020Some of the content was a bit repetitive. Each section and almost every video in each section is taught by a new person. As a result, a fair bit of content overlaps. I did think that the quiz sections could be improved as well. Often the questions barely related to the content in each week or would be about a very specific function or tool that wasn't even mentioned in the videos. This is helpful (1)Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Steven Hâ¢Oct 27, 2020The course is really a set of AWS product demonstrations that you could follow along with in the AWS Console.  The course had no other exercises or final project and quizzes were mostly 2-3 simple questions.  The content was good and the lecturers were experts.  It was not what you would expect of a Coursera course, but was a good introduction to AWS Machine Learning. This is helpful (1)Chevron Left 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 ... 61 Chevron Right
