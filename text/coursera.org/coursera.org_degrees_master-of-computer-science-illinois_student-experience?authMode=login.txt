The Coursera PlatformThe MCS program is developed and taught by the University of Illinois, and comes from the same faculty that teaches the on-campus MCS. Course staff host live office hours to answer student questions and help with coursework. Students also work together on group projects using Zoom and Slack, and get access to instructors during live office hours. There is a team of dedicated academic advisors in the computer science department to assist students. Every semester, the advising team hosts webinars to address student questions. The University of Illinois leverages Courseraâs online education platform to deliver the program curriculum, allowing MCS students to benefit from Coursera features such as interactive video transcription, in-course note taking, and seamless learning across multiple devices. Each course requires approximately 10 - 12 hours of work per week.Degrees on Coursera are powered by technology that empowers you to learn on your schedule and on the device of your choice. Courses are made up of modules that can be completed during commutes or other short periods of spare time. They include supplementary readings, video lectures, assignments, and discussion forums that help you spark connections with your peers.Illinois Computer Science Speaker SeriesThe Illinois Computer Science Speaker Series brings prominent leaders and experts to campus to share their ideas and promote conversations about important challenges and topics in the discipline. Join us online: talks are virtual this year!

I've been able to use some of the skills that I've learned through the program actively in my work, especially in the aspects of data cleaning. It's helped make my work more productive.What I like best about the program is the flexibility. Commutes are a major thing in today's society, and being able to do the lectures along in the commute. It really helps maximize time. What's been the most surprising about the program is despite the fact that it's at a distance, there's so many different software tools that you can use to stay in contact with your team members, as well as with the professors. I particularly love the Coursera platform, which was what made me so excited about the program to begin with. The assignments for the courses link up well with real-world work. Programming assignments are done through GitHub and GitLabs, just as it is at an actual job.â - Brad Ballard, MCS-DS Student, VeteranâI have been in cloud operations world for a very long time. You keep hearing about data science all the time. Iâm an engineer at heart, Iâve done software development, Iâve done architecture. Iâm a senior director now so I donât do as much hands-on work, but it was important for me to truly understand this field. Iâm just jazzed by the opportunities and the potential.I have a full-time job, so I couldn't go to campus. I couldnât even go to evening classes. So, to have unlimited access to the material and to the lectures and to professors on demand. Iâve done my lessons at 3 a.m. in the morning, Iâve done them at 3 p.m. in the afternoon. Having that flexibility was really important for me.if you are passionate about learning about data science and if you want flexibility from a high-quality of the program, itâs definitely worth taking a plunge. I think itâs a phenomenal option. - Ashish Kumar, MCS-DS StudentModular Course StructureLectures are organized into weekly modules, which can be absorbed via video playback or interactive transcript.
