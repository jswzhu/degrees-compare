Student ExperienceThe Coursera learners who are earning their Global Master of Public Health (GMPH) from Imperial College London come from a wide array of backgrounds, locations, and experiences. Despite these differences, however, they are united by their passion for learning, their commitment to achieving their career goals, and their desire to make a positive impact in the world.Choosing to enroll in a world-class degree programme is a tremendous step forward on your learning and career journey, but while youâre sure to be excited, it might also feel a bit like a step into the unknown. So weâd like to introduce you to some real-life GMPH students who can share insights about their backgrounds, reasons for joining this programme, and future career plans.We recently posed some questions to students Sue Meier, Roki Seydi, and Bharath Sundar, and you can explore their responses below.Please tell us a bit about yourself, your background, and your work and learning experiences prior to enrolling in this programme.Sue Meier:
I live just outside Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on a small horse farm with my husband John. Our three children are all grown up now and theyâve married and have left the nest. Iâve earned bachelorâs degrees in economics, political science, and nursing, and I have earned masterâs and doctorate degrees in neonatal nursing. I currently work as a neonatal intensive care nurse practitioner in the neonatal critical care unit at University of North Carolina Childrenâs hospital and have served as the  leader of the neonatal nurse practitioner team since 2000.  I recently completed the GlobalOne Masters in Business Administration (MBA) at the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler school of business, and am currently working on my Global Master of Public Health at Imperial College London on Coursera. Roki Seydi:
I graduated from Kingâs College London with a degree in Global Health and Social Medicine, and afterwards I completed a course in software development, which is what I do now. I am currently working for a health-tech start up at the intersection of these two fields, where I programme and create digital health applications backed by sound public health research.Bharath Sundar:
I am from the city of Chennai in Southern India. I completed my bachelorâs in electrical and electronics engineering from India in 2008, and since then I have done various jobs, from working to integrate GPS chips into off-market digital cameras, to being a finance director with eBay, where I was responsible for financial planning and analysis for all international operations. In 2019, I decided to devote more time to areas closer to my heart. After many discussions with friends and colleagues who worked in NGOs and in the government, I realized my interests in public health. I recognized I needed further education to understand the field, create my networks, and explore. That is when I decided to pursue my masterâs and found Imperialâs offering on Coursera.What motivated you to choose this specific course as opposed to studying elsewhere? Sue Meier: It was difficult for me to choose between studying at my home institution, University of Chapel Hill, Gillings School of Public Health, or Imperial College London. I ultimately chose Imperial College to enhance the global aspect of my MPH training and am so glad that I did. I am eager to pivot my career from local intensive care to global public health, whilst continuing to focus on maternal and infant health.Roki Seydi: I chose this course because I was intrigued by the interesting and exciting array of modules encompassing all aspects of public health - from machine learning to medical anthropology - which ultimately convinced me to decline a full scholarship to study public health elsewhere and accept the offer from Imperial. Bharath Sundar: Factors included flexibility through the online environment, studying in English, a favorable time zone to where I am based (Switzerland), and the fact that live classes through Zoom were part of the curriculum (I come from a non-health background and I needed access and frequent connection with people and professors). And of course, Imperial College London is well renowned.What are your plans for after you earn your degree?Sue Meier:
I am eager to pivot my career from delivering local neonatal intensive patient care in the United States, to providing global public health primary care abroad, while continuing to focus on maternal and infant health. I am actively seeking opportunities to do so, and I feel extremely well-prepared to begin a career in public health after having nearly completed the Imperial College London Global Master of Public Health training program. I have learned all the core skills required for entry into the profession. And, I have been provided a wealth of resources, references, networks, and contacts to support me in public health practice. I am not certain exactly what my next career opportunity will be just yet, but am looking forward to it nonetheless.Roki Seydi:
After my degree I would like to continue to work at the intersection of healthcare and technology. I would like to contribute towards the creation of health products and services with a strong scientific foundation, and also start an entrepreneurial journey around healthcare innovation. Bharath Sundar:
I have already begun a job in the NGO sector working on global public health projects in Central Africa and South Asia. I am a program officer for FAIRMED, an NGO based in Bern, Switzerland. It is an international public health and development NGO working with a mandate of health for the poorest. My portfolio in FAIRMED includes responsibility for projects in Nepal and Sri Lanka, and I am also the lead for our global Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEAL) workstream.Weâre grateful to these learners for their dedication to solving global health challenges, and we hope their insights are beneficial as you prepare to take this incredible leap forward in your life and career.The Coursera PlatformThe Global Master of Public Health programme is delivered as a fully online degree, via Coursera.
