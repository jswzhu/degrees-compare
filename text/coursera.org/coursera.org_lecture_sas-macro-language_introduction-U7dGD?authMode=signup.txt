Thank you for the content.Helpful?From the lessonWorking with Macro ProgramsIn this module, you learn to write and call macro programs to generate SAS code based on input values. You also learn about macro variable scope - where macro variables are stored and how long they are available. Finally you learn about conditionally generating and processing code using macro IF/THEN statements, and iterative processing with macro DO loops. Introduction0:42Taught ByStacey SyphusDirectorTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglishFrenchRussianSpanishptPt*  So far, we've used macro variables  to store text, possibly manipulate the value,  and substitute it into our program.  Now were ready to write macro programs that  generate SAS code.  Macro programs also store text, but they write code  based on input values.  In this lesson, you'll see how to define and call  a macro program, and we'll discuss macro variable scope.  It's critical to understand where  macro variables are stored and how long they're available.  Then we'll cover conditionally generating and processing  code using macro IF/THEN syntax, and iterative  processing with macro DO loops.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
