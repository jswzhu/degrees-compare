Beyond what we call `games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and a few applications.You can find a full syllabus and description of the course here:  http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/GTOC-Syllabus.html

The exercises however are not very well explained. Furthermore, it would be nice to have a pdf from the course in order to be able to study independently.Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Starby ASJan 26, 2019Excellent course for beginners. Problem sets are very creative. No more further resources needed. I found this course specially useful if the purpose is to apply Game Theory in other disciplines.Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Starby SCFeb 7, 2022I would have preferred a more mathematically rigorous treatment of the subject. Nevertheless, this was a great course â the instructors expounded all concepts with exceptional clarity and engagement.Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarby PRDec 11, 2018Amazing course! Gives great deal of insight into the subject! Just love the way Kevin explains! Matt could actually work on his stammering; or probably slow down a bit. The content was top notch! ;)View all reviewsFrequently Asked QuestionsWhen will I have access to the lectures and assignments?Access to lectures and assignments depends on your type of enrollment.
