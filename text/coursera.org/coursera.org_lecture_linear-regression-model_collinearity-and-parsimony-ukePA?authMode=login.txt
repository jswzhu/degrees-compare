These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnStatistics, Linear Regression, R Programming, Regression AnalysisReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Star4.8 (1,634 ratings)5 stars80.23%4 stars16.03%3 stars2.93%2 stars0.24%1 star0.55%MMSep 26, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Starlinear regression is well taught throughout the course, but I think learning other types of regression modeling would be useful as well and adding them to the course materials is really good.Helpful?ANSep 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course is structured in a very informative way, it is easy to understand and at the same time difficult concepts are presented in a very easy way. The course instructor is awesome.Helpful?From the lessonMultiple RegressionIn this week, weâll explore multiple regression, which allows us to model numerical response variables using multiple predictors (numerical and categorical). We will also cover inference for multiple linear regression, model selection, and model diagnostics. There is also a final project included in this week. You will use the data set provided to complete and report on a data analysis question. Please read the project instructions to complete this self-assessment.

Two predictor variables are said to be  collinear when they are correlated with each other.  Remember: predictors are also called independent variables,  so they should be independent of each other.  In other words, they should not be collinear with each other.  Inclusion of collinear predictors, also  called multicollinearity complicates model estimation.  And what we mean by complicates model estimation is that the  estimates coming out of the model may no longer be reliable.  Let's take a look back at our para weiss scatter plots  and remind ourselves that earlier we fit a model predicting poverty from  female householder and then we added the variable white or the  percentage of white residents living in that state to the existing model.  We saw that there were very little gains from adding the second  explanatory variable, because our r squared went up by just a tiny bit.  And in fact, our adjusted r squared did not go up at all.  So why might that be the case?  Let's take a look to see how the variables  white and female householder are related to each other.  We can see that there isn't much scatter in this  scatter plot displaying the relationship between white and female householder.  And, the correlation coefficient between these variables is quite  high, indicating a strong negative relationship between the two variables.  What that means is that the variable white is highly correlated with  the variable female householder, and therefore  they're not independent of each other.  If that is the case, we wouldn't want to add the variable white to our existing  model that already has female householder, because it's  going to bring nothing new to the table.  Any information that could be gleaned from  the variable white, is probably already being captured  by the variable female householder because these  two variables are highly associated with each other.  In addition, using both of these variables in the model is going to result in  multicollinearity which we said might also result in  unreliable estimates of the coefficients from the model.  And that discussion brings us to a new term, parsimony.  We want to avoid adding predictors that are associated with each other, because  often times the addition of such variable brings nothing new to the table.  We prefer the simplest best mode, in other words, the parsimonious model.  This is the model that has the highest  predictive power, however, has the lowest number of variables.  This idea comes from Occam's razor, which states that among  competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.  In other words, among models that are equally good, we  want to select the one that has the fewer variables.  We've also heard that addition of collinear variables  can result in biased estimates of the regression parameters.  So not only do we prefer simple parsimonious models, but we also want  to be very careful about adding a bunch of explanatory variables to a model.  Because if those are co-linear with each other,  the model estimates may no longer be reliable.  Lastly, while it is impossible to avoid co-linearity from arising in observational  data, experiments are usually designed to control for correlated predictors.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
