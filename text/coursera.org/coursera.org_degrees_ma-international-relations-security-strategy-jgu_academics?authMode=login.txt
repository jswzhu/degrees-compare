CurriculumCore coursesInternational Relations Theory and Praxis: Praxis investigates both the existing practices of international politics and relations both during and after the Cold War, and whether problems of praxis (individual and collective choices) can be subjected to a 'theoretical treatment'.Diplomatic Practice: In this course, youâll be given an introduction to the ecosystem within which diplomacy is practiced. This involves, but is not limited to: international relations, foreign policy, and the global architecture. It will also describe the role of Embassies, High Commissions, Consulates, Special Missions and Trade/Cultural Offices. Various types of diplomacy, namely, economic, cultural, diaspora, passport and consular services, and military intervention, in the context of war and peace, will be touched upon.Gain practical knowledge of how diplomacy is conducted and practiced by states defending their respective national interests. Diplomatic practice has evolved over centuries. It has recently undergone dramatic transformation due to globalization, speedier communication, and of course, the ubiquitous internet and social media. Yet, despite all this, diplomatic practice has retained some fundamental features such as the presence of Embassies, a role for Ambassadors, and the practice of various types of diplomacy, namely, economic, cultural and diaspora, to name a few. Maritime Security and Naval Strategy: In this course, youâll develop a comprehensive understanding of all prevailing maritime threats and challenges of the 21st century, with a focus on the Indo-Pacific region. The curriculum includes an overview of international maritime law covering the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and various IMO conventions related to maritime safety and security. The course will also cover a study of naval strategy and the contemporary role of world navies.Intelligence, War and Weapons: In this course, youâll discuss the fundamentals of intelligence gathering and will examine how warfare is conducted, the importance of weapons, and the strategies employed in different wars. You will examine ancient wars as well as studying contemporary wars. Youâll also look into different weapon systems and discuss the role and utility of new systems in defining new templates for wars. Terrorism, Counter-terrorism and Unconventional Threats: In this course, youâll begin exploring  the debate on terrorism, and examine how it differs from political violence. You will delve into the reasons behind the rise in terrorism, and the problems with taking joint-coordinated action against terrorism.  You will analyze the terrorist outfits active in central Asia, West Asia, South Asia, Europe and Africa in detail, and discuss the activities,resource and cadre mobilization of these groups. Foreign Policies of Great, Middle and Small Powers: In this course, you will discuss the foreign policies of various countries classified by size and comprehensive power. Develop your ability to compare and contrast the strategies of superpowers or great powers vis-Ã -vis weaker countries. Learn to approach key events counterfactually and counter-intuitively, developing a thorough understanding of policy making processes, causes, and consequences. Law and Ethics in International Relations: Normally when we talk about International Relations, we speak of power, interests, cost benefit analysis of states, and state actors. This course will introduce you to the major theoretical and applied dimensions of normative theories and international ethics by engaging you in critical debates surrounding complex moral questions of the contemporary world. Through a multidisciplinary approach, you will examine multiple ethical dilemmas of the 21st century in the context of debates about drone warfare, terrorism, torture, humanitarian interventions, climate change etc. to evaluate current international practices through a moral prism.Negotiating and Resolving International Conflicts: The study of international conflicts is highly fraught due to three reasons; multi-causality of the conflict, consequences ranging from micro to macro level, and the lack of accurate knowledge about the motivations of the parties in the conflict. In this course, youâll receive an overview of various theories that explain processes of negotiations, peacebuilding and conflict-transformation. It will enable you to rethink the efficacy of commonly accepted theories in light of case studies of conflict resolution from around the world, offer practical exercises of peace design, and develop tools to assess government and civil society actions in contexts of internal and inter-state armed conflict.List of Potential Elective Courses (subject to student enrollment)Interpreting International Current EventsMultilateral Institutions and Global SecurityMilitary Conflict and Deterrence in the 21st CenturyEthnic and National Conflicts in the Developing WorldForeign Policies of Developing Countries and South-South CooperationThe China-US New Cold War and the Indo-PacificTransnational Crime and Drug Trafficking in the AmericasClimate Change, Migration and Human SecurityWar and Peace in the Middle EastGeopolitics of Southeast AsiaIndiaâs Rise in World AffairsNuclear, Space and Cyber SecurityIntelligence Analysis and Risk AssessmentNational/Homeland Security-Institutions, Processes and PlanningDomestic Politics and their Impact on Foreign PolicyThe Role of Leadership in Foreign PolicymakingProgramme LengthThe programme can be completed in 24-36 months.FlexibilityThis program is 100% online.Coursera on MobileAccess course materials anywhere with the mobile app available on iOS and Android.Using the mobile app, learners can:Save a weekâs worth of reading and video content for offline access with one clickView text transcripts of lecture videosTake notes directly in the appSet reminder alerts to help you make progressDownload Coursera's mobile appLast date to submit applications: 15th February, 2023Classes start on: 1st March, 2023Click here to download brochureClick on 'Apply Now' to start your application or 'Request more info' to know more about the programme.If you have any questions, please contact online@jgu.edu.in.Want to learn more about the programme?
