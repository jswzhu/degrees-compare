These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnStatistics, Linear Regression, R Programming, Regression AnalysisReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Star4.8 (1,634 ratings)5 stars80.23%4 stars16.03%3 stars2.93%2 stars0.24%1 star0.55%MMSep 26, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Starlinear regression is well taught throughout the course, but I think learning other types of regression modeling would be useful as well and adding them to the course materials is really good.Helpful?ANSep 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course is structured in a very informative way, it is easy to understand and at the same time difficult concepts are presented in a very easy way. The course instructor is awesome.Helpful?From the lessonMultiple RegressionIn this week, weâll explore multiple regression, which allows us to model numerical response variables using multiple predictors (numerical and categorical). We will also cover inference for multiple linear regression, model selection, and model diagnostics. There is also a final project included in this week. You will use the data set provided to complete and report on a data analysis question. Please read the project instructions to complete this self-assessment.

Take a look at this data set of 1236 observations.  Where we have data from birth weight of babies  as well as a variety of variables on the baby, the birth, or the mother.  Imagine that we want to predict the birth weight of babies  from a set of these variables.  This is exactly what we mean by multiple regression.  We have a set of explanatory variables  that we use to predict a response variable.  We're going to be limiting our discussion to the case where the response variable is  numerical.  However, the explanatory variables can either be numerical or categorical.  For example in this case we have height and weight of the mother.  Those are numerical variables and whether or  not the mother smokes is that's a categorical variable.  So our response variable here is the birth weight of that baby.  And we want to try to predict that from a set of explanatory variables.  There's really no limit to how many of these you can have but  we're going to be talking about certain techniques for determining what is  a reasonable number or a reasonable set of variables to be included in the model.  We're going to start the unit with a discussion of  regression models with multiple predictors.  We're going to learn how to set up one of these models,  how to interpret the coefficient estimates,  as well as then talk about how to do inference for multiple linear regression.  We're going to talk about model selection, and  what we mean by model selection is which variable should be included versus why  should it not be included in the model.  And for that, we are going to consider things like is the variable a significant  predictor of the responsible or does it actually add something variable to  the model in terms of the predictive ability of the model.  Lastly, we're going to wrap up our discussion with model diagnostics.  These are basically the set of conditions that need to be met, for  our multiple linear regression model to be valid.  And just like with a regression with a single predictor,  we're going to talk about graphical diagnostic approaches for  determining whether the conditions for our model have been met.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
