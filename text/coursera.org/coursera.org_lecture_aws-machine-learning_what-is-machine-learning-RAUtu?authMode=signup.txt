I'm Kirsten Dupart with  AWS Training and Certification.  Welcome to this introductory course  on Amazon Machine Learning.  I've been with Amazon for a year and a half,  and I'm currently responsible  for curriculum development within  the AWS Training and Certification organization.  I'll begin this course with  an overview of machine learning,  and we'll talk about how data plays an important role.  After the overview, we'll  discuss an innovative way to build  smart applications and walk through a few use cases,  and then we'll wrap up with a discussion of  the AWS frameworks and services  you can use for machine learning applications.  Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence.  It helps you use historical data  to make better business decisions.  Machine learning is also  a process where machines take data,  analyze it to generate predictions,  and use those predictions to make decisions.  Those predictions generate results,  and those results are used to improve future predictions.  Machine learning can make predictions from huge datasets.  It can also optimize utility functions and extract  hidden patterns and structures from  those datasets by classifying data.  This enables a software program to  learn and make predictions in the future.  Machine learning enables you to  establish a cycle of improvement  using the data you collect from things like  clickstreams, purchases, and likes.  Machine learning is used in a number of  ways across a number of industries.  For example, it can be used  to detect fraudulent transactions,  filter spam emails, flag suspicious reviews, and so on.  You begin by mining large amounts of data to  identify patterns among the card transactions.  With these patterns, you can train the machine learning  model to flag fraudulent transactions.  It can also be used to personalize content for users  by recommending content and predictive content loading.  Machine learning can be used for targeted marketing,  matching customers with offers they might like,  choosing marketing campaigns, and  cross-selling or upselling items.  Machine learning can also be used to  automate categorisation of documents  such as matching hiring managers and  resumes by learning to understand written content.  It can be used in customer service to provide  predictive routing of customer emails  based on the content and the sender,  as well as social media listening capabilities.  Machine Learning systems discover  hidden patterns in data,  and use these patterns to predict patterns in the future.  For example, if you're analyzing retail data and  a product name contains words like jeans or jacket,  then this product category likely belongs to a parallel.  Machine learning systems learn from examples in  the same way that children learn language or patterns.  It can group data into a summary,  and it can also define data in  a more granular concise way.  Think of machine learning as  a combination of methods and systems.  These methods in systems  predict new data based on observed data,  extract hidden structure from the data,  summarize data into concise descriptions,  optimize an action given  a cost function and observed data,  and adapt based on observed data.  The field of machine learning is often classified into  the following broad categories: supervised learning,  unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.  In supervised learning, the inputs to the model  including the example outputs also known as labels,  are known and the model learns to  generalize the outputs from these examples.  In unsupervised learning, the labels aren't known.  The model finds patterns in  structure from the data without any help.  In reinforcement learning,  the model learns by interacting with  its environment and learns to take  action to maximize the total reward.  In supervised learning, the inputs to  the model in the example outputs are provided,  and the model learns to generalize  the outputs from these examples.  The human teachers experience is used to tell  the model which outputs are correct and which are not.  This doesn't mean that the teacher  has to be physically present,  only that the teachers' classifications must be present.  With the help of a large training dataset,  the model learns from its error and  changes its weight to reduce its prediction error.  In classification,  the output variable is a category like color,  which could be red, blue, or green,  and it results in true or  false for a particular question.  In regression, the output variable is a number  or a value like weight, dollars, or temperature.  In unsupervised learning which is also called  self-organization, there's no teacher.  It's based solely on local information.  Here, the model uses only the data  presented to the network without any labels,  and it detects the emerging properties  of the whole dataset.  The model then constructs patterns from  the available information without any pre-trained data.  In clustering, the model discovers groupings in  the data like grouping  customers based on their purchasing behavior.  In association, the model discovers  rules that govern large chunks of data,  for example customers who buy product A,  also tend to buy product B.  In reinforcement learning, a software agent determines  the ideal behavior within  a specific context for a particular problem.  The agent takes the input and  decides the best action for the problem,  and then based on the results of the action,  the agent than receives  simple reward feedback to  allow it to learn from its behavior.  The agent is encouraged to select an action  that maximizes the reward in the long-term.  This type of machine learning algorithm is  inspired by behavioral psychology.  Part of getting useful information out of  your Machine Learning system  is having a smart application.  Your smart application will use machine learning to  analyze your data and predict future outcomes,  which are necessary to make business decisions.  This can include using machine learning  for business questions such as predicting  customer trends like whether  customers will use a particular product of yours,  or to determine if an order is fraudulent.  Based on the customer data you already have,  you can find patterns in the data and then generate  predictions to drive your product  features and improvements.  While machine learning is a rapidly growing field  with an enormous upside for companies to use,  there are some challenges to take into consideration  when building your machine learning  based smart application.  For instance, some machine learning technology can  be complex to use and implement appropriately,  requiring high levels of  expertise that can take time to hire or develop.  Another challenge is finding  the right technology that  scales to the needs of customers.  Finally, being able to tie  machine learning to a business application can take time.  In other words, refining  your models so that your product app  can use that model  productively can require a lot of time.  These are the three primary  considerations you should take  into account when building  your machine learning application.  One way to help address these challenges  could be to use Amazon Machine Learning.  We have offerings in Amazon Machine Learning and  Spark on Amazon Elastic MapReduce or  Amazon EMR for customers who want to fully  manage platform for building models using their own data.  For developers and data  scientists who want to focus on building models,  the platform services  remove the undifferentiated overhead  associated with deploying and  managing infrastructure for training and hosting.  Amazon Machine Learning support  supervised machine learning approaches.  These enable you to predict  specific machine learning tasks  such as binary classification,  multiclass classification, and regression.  Binary classification predicts the answer  to a yes or no question.  For example, is this email spam or not spam?  Is this product a book or a toy,  or is this review written by a customer or a robot?  Multiclass classification  predicts the correct category from a list.  For example, is this product a movie or clothing?  Is this movie a romantic, comedy, documentary,  or thriller, or which category  of products is most interesting to this customer?  Regression predicts the value of a numeric variable.  For example, what will  the temperature be in Seattle tomorrow?  Or for this product,  how many units will sell?  Lastly, how many days before  the customer stops using the application?  At a broad level, these are the steps involved in  building a smart application  using Amazon Machine Learning.  To train a model, you need to create  a data source object pointing to your data,  explore and understand your data,  and transform data and train your model.  To then evaluate and optimize the model,  you need to understand model quality  and adjust model interpretation.  After that, you can retrieve  batch and real-time predictions.  Let's take a quick look at  a case study for using Amazon Machine Learning.  Zillow is a company that provides  home valuations online in the United States.  When the company needed to provide  more timely home valuations for customers,  they decided to run their home valuation tool using  Amazon Kinesis for data ingestion,  and Apache Spark on  Amazon EMR for data processing and analysis.  Now, Zillow runs its machine learning  tasks in hours instead of days,  and it provides more accurate valuation data too.  I hope you learned a little something and we'll  continue to explore our other courses.
