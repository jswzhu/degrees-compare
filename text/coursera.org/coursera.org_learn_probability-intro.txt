You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization.Flexible deadlinesFlexible deadlinesReset deadlines in accordance to your schedule.Shareable CertificateShareable CertificateEarn a Certificate upon completion100% online100% onlineStart instantly and learn at your own schedule.Beginner LevelBeginner LevelHours to completeApprox. 14 hours to completeAvailable languagesEnglishSubtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, German, Russian, English, SpanishCould your company benefit from training employees on in-demand skills?Try Coursera for BusinessSkills you will gainStatisticsR ProgrammingRstudioExploratory Data AnalysisFlexible deadlinesFlexible deadlinesReset deadlines in accordance to your schedule.Shareable CertificateShareable CertificateEarn a Certificate upon completion100% online100% onlineStart instantly and learn at your own schedule.Beginner LevelBeginner LevelHours to completeApprox. 14 hours to completeAvailable languagesEnglishSubtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, German, Russian, English, SpanishCould your company benefit from training employees on in-demand skills?Try Coursera for BusinessInstructorInstructor rating 4.83/5Â (667 Ratings)Mine Ãetinkaya-RundelAssociate Professor of the PracticeDepartment of Statistical Science 354,730 Learners 7 CoursesOffered byDuke UniversityDuke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge.

You will examine various types of sampling methods and discuss how such methods can impact the utility of a data analysis. The concepts in this module will serve as building blocks for our later courses.Each lesson comes with a set of learning objectives that will be covered in a series of short videos. Supplementary readings and practice problems will also be suggested from OpenIntro Statistics, 3rd Edition, https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics/, (a free online introductory statistics textbook, that I co-authored). There will be weekly quizzes designed to assess your learning and mastery of the material covered that week in the videos. In addition, each week will also feature a lab assignment, in which you will use R to apply what you are learning to real data. There will also be a data analysis project designed to enable you to answer research questions of your own choosing. Since this is a Coursera course, you are welcome to participate as much or as little as youâd like, though I hope that you will begin by participating fully. One of the most rewarding aspects of a Coursera course is participation in forum discussions about the course materials. Please take advantage of other students' feedback and insight and contribute your own perspective where you see fit to do so. You can also check out the resource page (https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro/resources/crMc4) listing useful resources for this course. Thank you for joining the Introduction to Probability and Data community! Say hello in the Discussion Forums.

Welcome to Week 4 -- the last content week of Introduction to Probability and Data! This week we will introduce two probability distributions: the normal and the binomial distributions in particular. As usual, you can evaluate your knowledge in this week's quiz. There will be no labs for this week. Please don't hesitate to post any questions, discussions and related topics on this week's forum (https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro/module/VdVNg/discussions?sort=lastActivityAtDesc&page=1).Also this week, you will be asked to complete an initial data analysis project with a real-world data set. The project is designed to help you discover and explore research questions of your own, using real data and statistical methods we learn in this class.
