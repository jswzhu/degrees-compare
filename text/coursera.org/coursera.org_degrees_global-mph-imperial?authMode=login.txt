Chevron RightIs the online programme the same as the on-campus programme?âFor the Global Masterâs in Public Health, weâve redesigned the high quality and multidisciplinary on-campus curriculum for the online environment. To this end the Global Master of Public Health aims to provide a comprehensive grounding in public health for students who wish to pursue or advance careers in public health practice, management and/or research at local, national and/or international levels.This online and part-time degree offers cutting-edge knowledge and skills based on the principles and methods of public health within a creative and supportive, fully-online learning environment. The programme has a special focus on the development of quantitative analytical skills for public health, epidemiology and health services research.
âChevron RightDo graduates of the online programme earn the same degree as graduates of the on-campus programme?âYes, graduates will earn the same Master of Public Health award as students in the on-campus programme. *Note that this is a UK-based degree. Students seeking specifically to be a public health physician in the US should seek an alternative US-accredited programme.âChevron RightCan you switch between online and on-campus programmes?âThe online and on-campus programme will suit different learners in different ways. Whilst both offer a Master of Public Health, the online programme is purely online and is offered for either two or three years, part-time. The on-campus programme is taught in London, over one year and is full-time. Both programmes are highly competitive and we encourage you to apply for the programme that best suits your needs in the first instance. It may not be possible to switch between the two programs if all the places have been filled.âChevron RightWhat is the time commitment required? Can working adults complete this programme?âYou will be required to take either two or three specialisations per term, depending on enrolment option, which run in parallel, so in total you should allocate roughly 18-24 hours a week to the degree programme. The majority of this time will be independent study- watching videos, reading core material, participating in discussion forums, and completing quizzes and peer reviews, though you can also expect to participate in weekly webinars, office hours, and Q&A sessions too. These will be scheduled in advance to help you plan your study time around your other commitments. There will be key assessment deadlines and dates that you will work to throughout.âChevron RightIs this degree accredited?âThe core aims and outcomes of this degree align with the European standards laid out by the Agency for Public Health Education Accreditation. This sets us apart from courses in countries such as the US and Canada, where accreditation requirements are not suitable for a UK based programme. Whilst this degree is not accredited by any particular agency or professional body, we have been able to design, develop and deliver an innovative and comprehensive public health curriculum which responds to the most recent developments in public health â including our own research discoveries - as our curriculum is unrestricted by specific criteria. âChevron RightWhat career options will I have with this degree?âIn public health, the focus is on populations and communities rather than individual patients. There are a number of career options in research, public or government services or voluntary organisations and non-governmental organisations. Starting from a common core, students may develop into roles ranging from public health analysts, health services researchers, communicable disease control consultants, environmental epidemiologists, health policy advisors or directors of public health.âChevron RightWhat is the school year schedule? âEach academic year is divided into three terms. For the two-year Masters programme, you will study three specialisations per term. During the three-year Masters programme you will study two specialisations per term. By the end of both you will have completed eight core specialisations, including a research portfolio and choose four optional specialisations. To enrol on the three-year Masters programme, you will first need to enrol and complete the Postgraduate Certificate and Postgraduate Diploma programmes.âChevron RightHow long does it take to complete the programme?âThe Masterâs level programmes are delivered and structured over either two years or three years, with three terms per academic year.You can either:enrol on the two year Masterâs programme as a standalone pathway, where you will study three specialisations per term (approx. 16-24 hours study time per week over 2 years), or;build to the Masterâs qualification over three years (approx. 12-18 hours per week). 
âChevron RightCan I transfer credits into the programme?âIt is not possible to transfer credits into the programme. You will need to meet the entry requirements of the programme and complete it in full in order to be awarded a Master of Public Health.âChevron RightAre there online office hours with instructors?âYes. There will be regular office hours with programme team staff and Faculty members. Outside of this there will be scheduled sessions and webinars where you will have access to Faculty staff who will instruct and support your learning.âChevron RightAre there networking opportunities to interact with fellow students?âYes, under the guidance of faculty advisors, you will be working with groups of fellow learners engaged in similar projects as you.âChevron RightDo the same faculty teach online and on-campus courses?âYes, many of your instructors will be the same leaders from academic fields such as statistics, epidemiology, and health services research that lecture on campus. âChevron RightHow does the online format work?âThis programme is fully online and involves no on-campus attendance at all. It will be taught fully online via the Coursera learning platform and allow learners to flexibly study around their own commitments, like employment, family, hobbies etc. The programme is designed in a way to allow learners to independently study for the majority of the program, watching teaching sessions and returning to them around their daily schedule. There will be live and scheduled sessions, or group based work which require pre-organised attendance and engagement throughout. Assessments will also have deadlines and require learners to engage and submit when stated.

Within these specialisations students will start to develop their own research in a fully supported learning environment.In the second half, they will finish their research portfolio, which will lead to a draft paper (academic or policy), blog and dissemination plan.

It is more intellectually demanding and challenging than undergraduate study. Students sometimes fail to appreciate the intense and demanding nature of Master's level programmes. There is no gradual introduction â the pace is fierce from the outset and it does not subside until the end. This requires a commitment to a sustained period of intensive work right from the start. In addition:â¢ the pace of lecturing is likely to be significantly fasterâ¢ you will be expected to undertake more directed background reading during the courseâ¢ you will be expected to arrive at solutions for yourself  For this reason the College requires a high academic standard of those seeking admission. International students, in particular, should also recognise the need to be proficient in English at the start of the course, hence the College's English language requirement.
âChevron RightIs work experience required?âWork experience is not essential but will be considered as part of the review process.
