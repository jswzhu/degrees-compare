You will learn how to prepare for the exam by exploring the examâs topic areas and how they map to SysOps Administration on AWS. You will review sample certification questions in each domain, practice skills with hands-on exercises, test your knowledge with practice question sets, and learn strategies for identifying incorrect responses by interpreting the concepts that are being tested in the exam. At the end of this course you will have all the knowledge and tools to help you identity your strengths and weaknesses in each certification domain areas that are being tested on the certification exam.

The AWS Certified SysOps Administrator â Associate (SOA-C02) exam is intended for system
administrators in a cloud operations role. The exam validates a candidateâs ability to deploy, manage, and
operate workloads on AWS and their ability to complete the following tasks: Support and maintain AWS workloads according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework, perform operations by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, implement security controls to meet compliance requirements, monitor, log, and troubleshoot systems, apply networking concepts (for example, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls), implement architectural requirements (for example, high availability, performance, capacity), perform business continuity and disaster recovery procedures and identify, classify, and remediate incidentsView SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCloud Computing Security, Software Deployment, AWS cloudFrom the lessonWeek 2Welcome to Week 2! This week, you will review relevant concepts and services for Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation (Domain 3) and Monitoring, Logging, and Remediation (Domain 1) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in these areas. Question walkthroughs for Domain 3 address the topics of provisioning and maintaining cloud resources, and automating manual or repeatable processes. For Domain 1, question walkthroughs cover using AWS monitoring and logging services, and remediating issues. In addition, this week features optional hands-on exercises for both domains so that you can practice your skills with creating a basic environment and automating with a monitoring solution. Accompanying video walkthroughs show one possible solution for addressing the requirements for each exercise.Introduction to Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation5:05Question Walkthrough: Provision and Maintain Cloud Resources6:45Lab Introduction: Creating a Basic Environment2:36Possible Lab Solution: Creating a Basic Environment8:05Understanding Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation3:11Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Blaine] Welcome to the  AWS Certified SysOps Administrator exam.  There are six domains in this exam.  Monitoring, Logging, and Remediation.  Reliability and Business Continuity.  Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation.  Security and Compliance.  Networking and Content Delivery.  And Cost and Performance Optimization.  In this course, we are going to take a look  at what each of these domains cover,  along with how questions related to those domains  might appear in the exam.  For each domain, we will do an in-depth analysis  of a representative question.  We'll break down the stem and responses  to help you understand why the key,  the right answer, is the correct choice.  Then, we'll have plenty of other questions  for each domain for you to test yourself  to see if you know the right answer,  and if you knew why it was the right answer.  I want to be clear, any items you see in this training  are not on the actual exam.  Okay, down to business.  We want to start in the middle of the list  and talk about Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation,  which is 18 percent of the total score for the exam.  Two subdomains here: provision and maintain cloud resources,  and automate manual or repeatable processes.  We've already said this, but I want to re-emphasize  that this course is not a training course  on the subject matter.  Instead, it's to help you evaluate  if you feel you are ready to sit the exam.  With that being said,  provisioning and maintaining cloud resources  is all about hands-free processes  that get your infrastructure up and running.  You should know how to create and manage AMIs.  For example, you should be familiar with EC2 Image Builder.  You should know AWS CloudFormation.  Know how to create, manage, and troubleshoot CloudFormation  in a live environment.  Next, provision resources across multiple AWS Regions  and multiple AWS accounts.  This means knowing tools  like the AWS Resource Access Manager,  CloudFormation StackSets,  and of course, know how to use IAM cross-account roles.  Select deployment scenarios and services.  For example, understand blue/green deployments,  rolling and canary environments.  And identify and remediate deployment issues.  For example, how to handle permissions issues.  What about service quotas?  What are they, why are they, and how they can be changed?  You should master VPC and subnet sizing.  And, of course, CloudFormation and AWS OpsWorks errors.  The second subdomain in deployment provisioning  and automation is automate manual or repeatable processes.  And this is about keeping human hands  out of a running environment as much as possible.  You should know how to use AWS services  to automate deployment processes.  For example, OpsWorks or CloudFormation,  and this also includes things like Elastic Beanstalk,  and AWS Systems Manager is fair game here.  Implement automated patch management  with a variety of different tooling options.  Schedule automated tasks by using AWS services.  For example, EventBridge or AWS Config.  Now, by the way, just because I don't call out  a specific AWS service here,  doesn't mean it's not fair game for the exam.  Any AWS service that has been generally available, or GA,  for more than 6 months could be used in an item.  Now, statistically speaking,  you can probably assume you won't get any question  on using AWS Ground Station,  because managing orbital satellites  is just not in most system operators' job description.  If it happens to be in yours, (calm music starts)  then I probably want to come work where you do!  And I probably shouldn't have said that part out loud  (calm music ends)  All right, that's it for Deployment, Provisioning  and Automation domain.  Know how to make your AWS system run hands-free  and you'll be well positioned here.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
