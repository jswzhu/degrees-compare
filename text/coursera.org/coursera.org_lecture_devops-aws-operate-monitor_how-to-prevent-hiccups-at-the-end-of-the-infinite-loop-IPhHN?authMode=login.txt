Monitoring and Operation are key aspects for both the release pipeline and production environments, because they provide instruments that help discover what's happening, as well as do modifications and enhancements on infrastructure that is currently running. 

This course teaches how to use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, as well as Amazon EventBridge and AWS Config for continuous compliance. It also covers Amazon CloudTrail and a little bit of Machine Learning for Monitoring operations!View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCI/CD, aws, DevopsReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarHalf-Filled Star4.6 (70 ratings)5 stars71.42%4 stars18.57%3 stars8.57%2 stars1.42%From the lessonWeek 2This week, you will start by learning about the importance of operation in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and discover how to detect unmanaged configuration changes to your cloud resources. Though this course focused on AWS solutions for DevOps operations and monitoring, you will also learn about third-party, open-source tooling that are well-known and widely used by the DevOps community. Lastly, you will get hands-on and run commands using AWS Systems Manager, and output logs to Amazon CloudWatch.Introduction to Week 2 - Operate1:47How to Prevent Hiccups at the End of the Infinite Loop4:06Detecting Unmanaged Configuration Changes to Your Cloud Resources3:28Taught ByRafael LopesPrincipal Cloud TechnologistAlana LaytonTechnical Curriculum DeveloperRussell SayersSenior Cloud TechnologistTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Raf] So far,  you have learned about some concepts in a CI/CD journey,  starting with the dev aspects, and moving towards  the ops part of the operation.  You should be familiar with this graphic,  which represents a complete DevOps journey  for a given application.  In this video, Alana and I will talk about  some things you need to take care of  in order to facilitate the smooth transition  between the end and the beginning of this feedback loop.  Let's say you applied everything you learned so far,  and you have an application created via CloudFormation and  orchestrated via CodePipeline.  If you have that,  it is likely that you will have it updated  whenever pushes are made to the CloudFormation template,  hosted on CodeCommit.  Although that's awesome,  I have a question for Alana.  Alana, how would you try to predict a failure  due to a hidden bottleneck?  - [Alana] Good question.  Let's consider a few examples to visualize that problem.  Imagine that you modify your CloudFormation template to  separate your environment into different VPCs.  So instead of a couple of VPCs,  you now may want to use tens of them.  Or perhaps your Lambda functions are working pretty hard and  you want to increase the maximum concurrent executions.  Well, if you leave everything on the defaults for your AWS  accounts and had never requested a soft-limit increase,  this update stack operation would potentially fail because  there's a limit on the number of VPCs you can have in a  Region, as well as the number of concurrent  Lambda function executions.  Depending on how you have your CI/CD configured,  that stack update failure could prevent other developers  from pushing changes until it's resolved.  Now, there is an AWS service called Service Quotas,  which gives you a list of the AWS default quota value  and the applied quota value in your AWS account.  It's always worth checking  if you're increasing capacity of a given resource.  Of course, you can also do API calls  to Service Quotas to get these numbers programmatically,  which might be instrumental to incorporate  in the build part of your pipeline.  So, let's say you're not facing any limit issues  in an update stack operation.  What about other things that could break the flow?  - [Raf] Great question, Alana.  For the sake of having everything going smoothly  with CloudFormation at the end of your CI/CD,  I would like to talk about an important feature,  CloudFormation change sets.  There are three ways to change an AWS environment  created by CloudFormation.  The first one is directly touching the resources,  which you should avoid doing,  and you will understand why later in this course.  The second method is updating the stack directly.  And the third one,  which is a little bit more sophisticated,  is by using that CloudFormation feature called change sets.  The advantage of change sets is that you can predict,  a little bit, the result of an update stack operation  by having CloudFormation telling you what will be changed.  So you can double-check  if that's really what you want before proceeding.  Here, you can see the JSON that was generated  by submitting a modified template  that removes an EC2 instance and adds  an Auto Scaling group with a launch configuration.  It is pretty simple to understand.  It gives you what will be changed in the section, Changes,  of the JSON.  And here, you can clearly see that two resources  are being added and one is being removed,  which is the EC2 instance.  It is always a good idea to use CloudFormation  change sets for production environments.  Once you have an original stack running,  you submit a change set, view the change set.  If everything looks good, you can execute the change set.  Otherwise, you do additional change sets  or cancel the entire operation.  - [Alana] All right, smooth operator.  Let's move on.  You ready, Raf?  - [Raf] Yeah, I'm ready!Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
