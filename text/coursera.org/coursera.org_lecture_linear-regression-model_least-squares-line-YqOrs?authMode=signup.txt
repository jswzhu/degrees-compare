These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio.View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnStatistics, Linear Regression, R Programming, Regression AnalysisReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Star4.8 (1,634 ratings)5 stars80.23%4 stars16.03%3 stars2.93%2 stars0.24%1 star0.55%MMSep 26, 2021Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled Starlinear regression is well taught throughout the course, but I think learning other types of regression modeling would be useful as well and adding them to the course materials is really good.Helpful?ANSep 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course is structured in a very informative way, it is easy to understand and at the same time difficult concepts are presented in a very easy way.

Many of you may be familiar with regression from reading the news, where graphs with straight lines are overlaid on scatterplots. Linear models can be used for prediction or to evaluate whether there is a linear relationship between two numerical variables.

We can't simply add up all of the residuals  because some of them are going to be negative and  some of them are going to be positive, depending on  whether the model is over or underestimating certain data points.  So we need to come up with a more clever approach.  One option is minimize the sum of magnitudes,  or in other words absolute values of their residuals.  Another option to minimize the sum of  square residuals, and this is what we called  the least squares, and this is the option that we're going to be sticking with.  So, why least squares?  This is, indeed, the most commonly used approach.  And it's also easier to compute by hand as well as using software.  But most importantly, in many applications, a residual twice  as large as another is more than twice as bad.  We had used the same idea when we calculated  the standard deviation earlier in the course is why.  This is the general form of the least squares line.  We have our explanatory variable x, that gets multiplied by this slope beta  1, and we also have an intercept where the line intersects the y axis.  And finally we have y hat which stands  for the predicted value of the response variable.  Before we talk more about how we actually come up with  this line, let's first focus a little bit on the notation.  Once again we have data from a sample and we are  going to be using that sample to estimate unknown population parameters.  The unknown population parameter for the intercept is beta 0, and  the point estimate counterpart of it, the observed value, is b,0.  So once again, we're using the Greek alphabet, Latin  alphabet approach for denoting our parameters and point estimates.  Similarly, for the slope, the parameter is beta 1, and the point estimate is b,1.  So how do we estimate the regression parameters?  Let's start with the slope.  Remember earlier, we said that this is a least squares line.  In other words, we're minimizing The sum of squared residuals.  To minimize sum of squared residuals, we could actually use a little  bit of calculus and calculate the slope and the intercept using that approach.  However, since this is not a calculus-based  course, we'll actually introduce some shortcut formulas.  So we can calculate the slope b,1 as  the standard deviation of y divided by the standard  deviation of x you may have heard of this  as rise over run times R the correlation co-efficient.  Let's illustrate this with an example, the standard  deviation of percentage living in poverty is 3.1%  And the standard deviation of percentage of high  school graduates is 3.73% in our data set.  Given that the correlation between these variables is -.75.  What is the slope of the regression line for predicting  percentage living in poverty from percentage of high school graduates?  First, let's parse through the information that's given us in the problem.  We're told that the standard deviation of percentage living in poverty is 3.1%.  So we can say that s,y is 3.1%.  Because remember, poverty is our response variable.  And we are also told that the standard deviation of percentage  of high school graduates is 3.73% so that x is 3.73%.  We are also given the correlation co-efficient as negative  0.75 so putting all of these in the formula For the slop.  B1 equals Sy over Sx times R.  We simply need to plug in the numbers, 3.1 divided by 3.73 times  negative 0.75, gives us a slope of negative 0.62.  Note that the sine of the slope is always going  to be equal to the sine of your correlation coefficient.  Conceptually speaking, this is true, because  we're clearly seeing a negative relationship  between the two variables so it makes sense that the slope is negative.  Mathematically speaking, remember that the standard deviation  is the square root of the variants.  And it's a measure of variability.  So the standard deviation of y and x are  always going to necessarily have to be positive numbers.  In the first part of the equation, we're dividing two  positive numbers, which is always going to yield a positive response.  And then we're multiplying by a value that could be negative or  positive, depending on, on the direction  of the relationship between the two variables.  So mathematically speaking as well, the sign of the slope is always  going to be the same as the sign of the correlation coefficient.  Calculating the slope by hand is clearly  very simple and actually sometimes unnecessary as well  because often times, we don't calculate these  values by hand, but we simply use computation.  What is really important is how do we interpret this number, negative 0.62.  For each percentage point increase in high school graduate rate.  We would expect the percentage living in poverty  to be lower on average by 0.62% points.  There are few things to remember here first the interpretation of the slope  is about the relationship between your explanatory and your response variable.  In other words, how do we expect the response variable  to change As we increase the explanatory variable by 1 unit.  When we're interpreting these, we also want to make sure that if we are dealing  with an observational study; such as the  one we have here, we avoid causal language.  So this is why we're saying that we Expect this to  happen on average as opposed to interpreting this value as something.  Like if you increase high school graduation rate by 1 percentage  point, you would be able to decrease poverty by .62 percentage points.  Next, we want to estimate the intercept and remember that  the intercept is where the regression line crosses the y axis.  For this, we're going to make use of the property that  the least squares line always goes through x bar, y bar.  In other words, it's always going to go through the mean of y and x.  We know that we can write the linear model as  y hat equals b0, the intercept, plus b1 times x.  And all we need to do now is to plug in x bar and y bar in our equation because we  know that the line has to go through this point and  rearrange things a bit to get the formula for the intercept.  So by rearranging a bit, we can see that the  intercept can be calculated as the average value of the  response variable minus the slope, which we already calculated in  the first step, times the average value of the exponetory variable.  Let's see how we can do that.  Given that the average percentage living in poverty is 11.35%,  and the average percentage of high school graduates is 86.01%.  What is the intercept of the regression line for predicting  percentage living in poverty, from percentage of high school graduates?  One value that's given to us is the  average value of the response variable, that's 11.35%.  Another value that's given to us is  the average value of the explanatory variable, 86.01%.  And we also know that we can calculate the intercept as  simply the average value of the response variable, minus the slope  times the average value of the explanatory variable and we calculated  the slope in the previous step as negative .62 as well.  So we have all the building blocks we just need to plug  them into the equation and the intercept comes out to be 64.68%.  Once again, the calculation is very simple once you have these givens.  And most of the time you're not going to need to do this calculation by hand.  What is important is to understand 2 important points.  1, that the regression line always goes through the center of the data.  And 2, how do we interpret the intercept?  Remember, the intercept is where we said the regression line crosses the Y axis.  In other words, it's the expected value of the  response variable when the explanatory variable is equal to zero.  So, in context, what we can say is that, states with no high school graduates  Are expected on average to have 64.68%  of their residents living below the poverty line.  Does this seem realistic, that there would be states  in the U.S. with absolutely no high school graduates?  Looking at the data we have that actually seems very unlikely.  We can see that all the states in the US actually have high school graduation rate  varying somewhere between 75% to about 95%, maybe.  So mathematically speaking, this is a construct that  is important for putting together our linear model.  However, in context, it is not a very useful number.  So putting the information together from the previous two steps,  we can write our linear model as a predicted percentage  living in poverty, is equal to 64.68, the intercept, minus  0.62, the slope, times the percentage that are high school graduates.  If instead of calculating these values by hand, we had  actually used computation, the regression output would look something like this.  Depending on the software you're using, you might get slightly different  formatting, but usually this is the  general constart for the regression output.  We can see our inner set.  And we can see that it's slightly off  from what we calculated and that's probably simply due  to rounding and we can also see our slope  as the estimate that's associated with the explanatory variable.  We are going to talk about what the standard are, the  t score and the p value mean later on in the course.  So for now let's just focus on the estimates column, where we can find  what we call our parameter or coefficient estimates for the slope and the intersect.  So to recap, we interpret the intercept as when  x equals 0, y is expected to equal the intercept.  As we discussed, this may be a meaningless value in context of the data, and  in those cases it might only be serving to adjust the height of the line.  The interpretation of the slope is slightly different,  since it's about the relationship between the two variables.  For each unit increase in x.  Y is expected to be higher or lower on average by the value of the slope.  So this basically tells us as we increase x by  one unit, what do we expect to happen to y?  And once again, depending on the type of study you have, you want to  be careful about interpreting the slope in a causal versus a correlational way.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
