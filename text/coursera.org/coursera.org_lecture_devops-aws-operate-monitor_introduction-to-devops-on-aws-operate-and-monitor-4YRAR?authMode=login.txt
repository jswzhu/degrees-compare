Monitoring and Operation are key aspects for both the release pipeline and production environments, because they provide instruments that help discover what's happening, as well as do modifications and enhancements on infrastructure that is currently running. 

This course teaches how to use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, as well as Amazon EventBridge and AWS Config for continuous compliance. It also covers Amazon CloudTrail and a little bit of Machine Learning for Monitoring operations!View SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCI/CD, aws, DevopsReviewsFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarHalf-Filled Star4.6 (70 ratings)5 stars71.42%4 stars18.57%3 stars8.57%2 stars1.42%From the lessonWeek 1This week, you will start by reviewing topics covered in the first and second courses of the DevOps on AWS series. You will then learn about the importance of monitoring and why instrumenting your environment is helpful. You will explore how Amazon CloudWatch provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. Lastly, you will get hands-on with other important AWS solutions to monitor pipeline changes.Introduction to DevOps on AWS: Operate and Monitor2:50Taught ByRafael LopesPrincipal Cloud TechnologistAlana LaytonTechnical Curriculum DeveloperRussell SayersSenior Cloud TechnologistTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Raf] Hi there! In previous courses,  you should have learned about the other DevOps components--  such as plan, code, build, test, release, and deploy--  where you learned important aspects  on how to get your CI/CD in an automated state  for application and infrastructure changes.  My name is Rafael Lopes, but you can call me Raf.  I am one of the instructors for this AWS course  about monitoring and operation, which are the final parts  of a full CI/CD DevOps workflow.  Monitoring and operation are key aspects  for both the release pipeline and production environments  because they will give you instruments  that will help you know what's happening,  as well as do modifications and enhancements  on infrastructure that is currently running.  In this course, you will learn how to use AWS services  to control your architecture in order to reach  a better operational state.  And I plan on doing that  by dividing the topics into 2 weeks,  where I will talk about monitoring in the first week  and operations in the second week.  For the monitoring week,  the content is divided into the cloud, application,  and networking environments, with some relevant AWS services  for doing monitoring.  In regards to the cloud environment,  we will be covering CloudWatch metrics,  alarms, and logs for monitoring,  as well as Amazon EventBridge and AWS Config  for continuous compliance.  We will also be talking about CloudTrail,  and a little bit of machine learning  for monitoring operations.  For application monitoring, Alana will talk about  AWS X-Ray, CloudWatch custom metrics,  and CloudWatch synthetics.  And for network monitoring, Alana will talk about  VPC Flow Logs and some other cool features.  You may recognize Alana from a previous course  as part of the DevOps series here in this platform.  She was one of the instructors  for a good portion of the CI/CD part of the DevOps workflow,  the release and deploy.  If you haven't watched that course yet,  I recommend pausing and going back,  because many of the components we will be talking about here  require some prerequisites taught in that course.  This course will also have hands-on activities  brought to you by my friend, Russ Sayers,  directly from Australia.  At the end of the week, we will offer an exercise  that will help you use AWS monitoring services  to monitor activities made in the AWS CodePipeline.  That's it.  I hope you enjoy it.  Welcome to the first week of the DevOps course  about monitoring and operations.  Ready to instrumentalize and monitor everything?  I am!Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
