operate workloads on AWS and their ability to complete the following tasks: Support and maintain AWS workloads according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework, perform operations by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, implement security controls to meet compliance requirements, monitor, log, and troubleshoot systems, apply networking concepts (for example, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls), implement architectural requirements (for example, high availability, performance, capacity), perform business continuity and disaster recovery procedures and identify, classify, and remediate incidentsView SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCloud Computing Security, Software Deployment, AWS cloudFrom the lessonWeek 1Welcome to Exam Prep: AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate! In this course, we present content about the six knowledge domains that are covered in the exam. All domains on the exam are covered. However, we don't present the domains in the order they are listed in the exam guide. We cover the domains in a specific sequence so that we can build on various concepts from module to module, and to help you identify areas for further study. It's important to understand that on the exam, questions from all domains are presented in random order. 

In this week, you will learn about the value of being AWS Certified. You will also get an overview of AWS Certification exams: what exams are available, how an exam is structured, and how to register and prepare for an exam.Welcome to Exam Prep: AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate3:13Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Seph] Hi, and welcome to our Certification course  for the Associate Level of the AWS Certified SysOps  Administrator exam.  This course is intended to provide you  with basic information around AWS Certifications,  give you guidance around what topics  and services may be covered by the exam,  and to help you determine if you feel ready to proceed  with registering and sitting for the exam.  The first thing I want to stress is  that this course should be seen  as more of a self-assessment.  This is not meant to take you from new to AWS  all the way to sure to pass the exam.  Think of it more as a way  for you to evaluate your familiarity  and comfort level with the topic areas, or domains,  that will be covered by the exam.  After completing this course,  you may find you're ready to move on to taking the exam,  or you might feel like you have a lot  of studying left to do.  Either way, this course is here to help you highlight  where you are and where you need to focus from here.  The next thing I want to do is let you know  that this is based off of the exam guide  that you can find on the landing page,  specifically for the SysOps Administrator exam.  In the segments, we will be defining the domains  and pointing out some of the topics and services  you should have knowledge and experience of  as you prepare to move forward.  Third, make sure you are paying close attention  to the test-taking and question-evaluation strategies  that are covered in the early part of the course  and referenced throughout.  This information will help you, regardless of topic,  and will provide a structure for your approach  to the questions and practical components.  Speaking of practical components,  it is important that you have hands-on experience  with using AWS.  So important, the Certification exam actually  has a hands-on component that goes into your scoring.  We'll talk about that during the course,  but we've also included some sample exercises  for you to practice with as you prepare for the exam.  Note that these are designed to work within your own  account, but also be mindful of possible charges  that could be accrued.  If you decide to do the exercises in your account,  make sure you remove any unnecessary resources  once you're done.  The last subject I want to emphasize is that,  as you've likely noticed, the world of AWS is constantly  changing and growing.  While we try to encompass as much information  as we can in our domain summaries,  you should be looking through the documentation  and getting as much hands-on experience as you can.  There is no way we could cover everything  and your personal study will be the best way for you  to stay up to date.  As I said earlier, this course is meant  to help you assess your readiness for the exam.  Good luck going through the domains,  and make sure you're taking notes.  Only you can determine what further study you need,  but this should help make that clearer.  And with that, I'll let you get started.
