You will learn how to prepare for the exam by exploring the examâs topic areas and how they map to SysOps Administration on AWS. You will review sample certification questions in each domain, practice skills with hands-on exercises, test your knowledge with practice question sets, and learn strategies for identifying incorrect responses by interpreting the concepts that are being tested in the exam. At the end of this course you will have all the knowledge and tools to help you identity your strengths and weaknesses in each certification domain areas that are being tested on the certification exam.

The AWS Certified SysOps Administrator â Associate (SOA-C02) exam is intended for system
administrators in a cloud operations role. The exam validates a candidateâs ability to deploy, manage, and
operate workloads on AWS and their ability to complete the following tasks: Support and maintain AWS workloads according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework, perform operations by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, implement security controls to meet compliance requirements, monitor, log, and troubleshoot systems, apply networking concepts (for example, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls), implement architectural requirements (for example, high availability, performance, capacity), perform business continuity and disaster recovery procedures and identify, classify, and remediate incidentsView SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCloud Computing Security, Software Deployment, AWS cloudFrom the lessonWeek 4Welcome to Week 4! This week, you will review relevant concepts and services for on Security and Compliance (Domain 4) and Cost and Performance Optimization (Domain 6) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in these areas. The Domain 4 question walkthroughs cover data and infrastructure protection, and security and compliance policies. For Domain 6, the question walkthroughs focus on cost-optimization strategies and performance-optimization strategies. This week also includes a practice assessment that includes questions from all exam domains.Introduction to Security and Compliance5:14Question Walkthrough: Data and Infrastructure Protection9:17Understanding Security and Compliance4:36Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- Blaine] Welcome back.  We want to look deeper into a question  in the Security and Compliance domain.  So, let's pick one from subdomain 4.2.  Identify and implement data protection,  encryption, and capacity planning.  Reminder, this question is not from the actual exam,  but is at the same structure and difficulty  of one you might find there.  Ready? Here's the stem.  A company is migrating its applications and data  from on-premises to the AWS Cloud,  including 500 terabytes of data that must move to Amazon S3.  There are concerns about time, cost, and performance.  What is the fastest and most cost-effective way  to perform the migration?  Break it down, what do you see?  Well, the first point that jumps out to me,  is migrating 500 terabytes. That's terabytes with a T.  This is not just a 30-second cat video here.  So, what's the value judgment here?  Time, cost, performance,  specifically, fastest and most cost-effective way?  This is a little unusual for a cert question.  Normally, there is only one primary value: speed or cost.  You can be fast or cheap, as the old saying.  But here, they are looking for a response  that solves both simultaneously. Interesting.  So before I post the responses,  do you know what option you would like to see here?  What is a solution you're hoping for?  And is it in one of these responses?  Let's go ahead and take a look  at the four options that are available.  Option A. Perform a network-based copy of the data  from the on-premises network to the destination S3 bucket.  B. Use multiple instances of the AWS Snowball client  on multiple workstations with multiple AWS Snowball Edge  compute-optimized appliances.  C. Use multiple instances of AWS Snowball client  on multiple workstations with multiple AWS Snowball Edge  storage-optimized appliances.  D. Use AWS Storage Gateway, file gateway type,  and facilitate an on-premises copy  using the file gateway mount point.  (groans)  Pause a moment, and see if your specific answer is here.  If so, congratulations!  But, let's go through the responses  here a little differently,  and assume that you did not see your favorite answer here.  Or perhaps you are sure, but then not so sure  once you saw the other responses.  A great tip I use when I sit these exams,  is to rule out the wrong answers first.  Often, you're left with the only correct answer  as the last option standing.  So let's group these responses together  based on major categories.  The first pair here, responses A and D  are both types of, push the content over the internet.  The second pair, responses B and C are both, use Snowball.  The value we must solve for is speed and cost.  So let's solve for speed first of all,  and that should eliminate one of these two pairs.  So, how fast is the internet, and how fast is Snowball?  (chuckles)  There's a basic assumption we do need to make.  Every business is different, every building is different.  But public internet uploads are limited,  based on the pipe attached to your specific building  where you're pushing from.  So, let's assume that you've got amazing fiber  and can push a full GB-per-second upload.  Quick math, says that to load 500 terabytes,  you're looking at over 46 days of uninterrupted,  uncapped, unthrottled, error-free loading,  just to complete the push.  And by the way, that's just the speed issue here.  Many providers love data-transfer costs  once you pass thresholds  that could push data transfer costs unexpectedly high,  but let's stay focused on speed here, okay?  Now, let's look at Snowball devices  and their transfer times.  Snowball devices plug directly into your local network,  load your content, get handed off to the courier,  and are delivered directly to the target AWS Region.  Default shipping option: 2-day delivery.  Yep, a delivery truck is faster than the internet at scale.  And don't even get me started about Snowmobile,  because, seriously, wow!  (laughs)  Back to our responses.  That makes the A and D distractors incorrect.  They certainly work,  but based on our values-speed, in this case-  they're clearly not the correct response.  But wait, wait, horses-and-zebra moment here.  Some of you may be thinking about a case  where the data center might live in a location  that doesn't have easy access to Snowball delivery.  Don't talk yourself out of the right answer  for this Certification.  Most of the world can get Snowball access,  in fact, there's amazing customer stories  about using Snowball devices in Antarctica.  And I know that somewhere there's a good joke  about using Snowballs in the South Pole,  I just can't seem to make it work.  Anyway, my point is, unless the stem  specifically calls out a scenario  where using Snowball would be categorically impossible,  assume the question writer  intended it to be a viable option.  All right. (sighs)  Two responses down, two to go.  Both B and C are Snowball devices,  so generally speaking, there should be no speed difference  between these options,  and it's why the stem asks for speed and cost.  So, choosing between these two  means knowing which one is the less-expensive option.  Now, pretend you don't know. (chuckles)  So, look at the two product names here,  storage-optimized or compute-optimized.  But you're not doing any compute here,  it's just store and ship,  and this would make storage-optimized  the right choice, perhaps.  But what if you weren't sure that storage-optimized  was actually a type of Snowball?  I mean, it seems silly, right?  I mean, let's be honest.  Snowball is already a storage device.  Compute-optimized? That makes sense.  Once you add edge computing, and that would be a thing,  but to call a Snowball storage-optimized?  Why, that feels like a trick.  And this could seem like the kind of name  someone might make up to trap an unsuspecting candidate.  And so, we get to the idea of the trick question.  This is an important fact in understanding  how AWS writes Certification items.  AWS does not invent fake service names  for their Certifications.  If you actually saw, on an exam,  a product called the AWS Interstellar Communicator,  (electronic sounds)  then, even if you don't recall ever hearing about that,  you could trust there actually is such a product.  Now, the distractor might ask that the service be used  in a way that is technically impossible,  such as assigning your SQS an Elastic IP address.  Those are both real services,  but that combination?  (chuckles) Not a thing.  So, back to our remaining responses,  storage-optimized versus compute optimized.  We know both must be real products,  so the decision becomes clear.  Storage-optimized is the key, the correct answer.  Now, if you actually want to go look up the costs,  you can go to aws.amazon.com/snowball/pricing,  but it turns out that once you account  for storage-capacity difference and base job fees,  that compute-optimized option  may be around 10 times the cost.  By far, not the most cost-effective choice.  So, there we have it.  A, B, and D are all distractors,  plausible and yet wrong,  while C is the key for this question.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
