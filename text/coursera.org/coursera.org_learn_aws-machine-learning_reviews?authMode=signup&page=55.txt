The World Economic Forum states the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) could create 58 million net new jobs in the next few years, yet itâs estimated that currently there are 300,000 AI engineers worldwide, but millions are needed. This means there is a unique and immediate opportunity for you to get started with learning the essential ML concepts that are used to build AI applications â no matter what your skill levels are. Learning the foundations of ML now, will help you keep pace with this growth, expand your skills and even help advance your career. 

This course will teach you how to get started with AWS Machine Learning. Key topics include: Machine Learning on AWS, Computer Vision on AWS, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) on AWS. Each topic consists of several modules deep-diving into variety of ML concepts, AWS services as well as insights from experts to put the concepts into practice....

It can be divided in to several short videos. Seeing a long video is creating a boredom. Otherwise it is a very nice course.Helpful?ANApr 12, 2020Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarThe course materials and lecture delivery was just one of a kind,I have learnt a complete skill on Machine Learning and its Algorithms.I hope this will lead me towards a next level of Data science.Helpful?See all 5 star reviewsFilter by:All LearnersChevron DownAll StarsChevron DownSort by:  Most HelpfulChevron Down1351 - 1375 of 1,512 Reviews for Getting Started with AWS Machine LearningFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy IT5028_Pinkesh Mâ¢Jul 7, 2020niceThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy MADDALI R Râ¢Jul 7, 2020goodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Sanket Gâ¢Jul 4, 2020goodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy KOLLU P K Râ¢Jul 4, 2020goodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy nilabha bâ¢Jun 13, 2020GoodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy jigyasa jâ¢Jun 7, 2020goodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Koustav Mâ¢Jun 7, 2020goodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Mahima sâ¢Jun 4, 2020goodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Mohini Câ¢May 30, 2020goodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Harshal Bâ¢May 21, 2020GoodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy PINKU Pâ¢Apr 21, 2020goodThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy yash tâ¢Apr 18, 2020coolThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarBy Aditya R Râ¢Apr 14, 2020FINEThis is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy German Sâ¢Jul 1, 2020This course is too focused in how to implement machine learning for business using AWS products, it can be disappointing for data scientists since they show the use of AWS tools skipping over a lot of machine learning fundamentals. Additionally, there is no code assignments and the quizzes are about telling what AWS tool is the best choice for different business problems.I learned interesting things and tools in this course, but because I have prior knowledge of data science and machine learning. Additionally I spent some time doing my own tests on AWS Sagemaker by myself.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Ana Tâ¢Oct 27, 2019This is an okay introduction to ML and AI, but the overall course content could have been consolidated. As it is right no it feels like a collection of AWS videos already available on the internet, with some of the content even duplicated. The hands-on labs do not really feel hands-on and some key concepts are only brushed upon, while the quizzes are sometimes not even related to the course content. On the introduction to precision and accuracy for example, the formula was incorrect in the video and the quiz treated recall, which was not even explained in the course.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Maulishri Bâ¢May 6, 2020The course was very well communicated. But I was really disappointed that it was not communicated about the minor details like to close all and delete all instances of any usage of sagemaker profiles, usage of s3 bucket or any other service. Since I did not delete these, I was charged a huge amount. This is not at all acceptable and I was very disappointed that such an important detail was not communicated. Very very disheartening.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Prateek Kâ¢May 6, 2020Well,theyarepromotingtheirMLSoftwarejustlikeotherswoulddobutItwas related to ML, only in the last week. No doubt, Sagemaker and other softwares are good, but we need to have more examples and/or at least more details of these frameworks. like which file size would used for what purpose.(your nomenclature needs to be discussed more unless they're not strategically discussing it.)This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Hiren Kâ¢Jul 2, 2020Some videos were difficult to understand. Also, there is some redundancy between some of videos (describing same functionality, etc.). And, it'd be good to get a big picture view of what all services are available, and how they are related/different, and how can they be used in real-life situations (introducing  of one thing at a time makes it bit difficult)This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Robert D L Câ¢Jul 2, 2020The course provided a lot of good information about the AWS products which I appreciate, however, I could've used some hands-on examples to follow along. The SAS certification course offered in Coursera has a free environment and videos walk you through examples. Also, the quizzes have too few questions to accurately test user knowledge gained in the videos. This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Deepak K G Sâ¢Apr 26, 2020The course provides a good overview of all the services amazon provides for the machine learning . The topics covered include rekognition , Comprehend , Transcribe , Glue , Sagemaker , Sagemaker Neo . This course is only recommended for those who do not have any knowledge about aws and would like to learn and get an overview of various services .This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Thales B Fâ¢Apr 18, 2020Nice course to get an overview about AWS ML products, though I would suggest to have more background explanations regarding the ML subject itself in order to help understand better AWS products and the approaches followed on each solution. It would also be highly recommended to have a way of experimenting those products in a sandbox style.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Xia Hâ¢Nov 10, 2019I was hoping to learn more ML with AWS. The quiz are too simple and there are no practical assignments which I can go through AWS myself. After only watching the videos I could not remember so much unfortunately. I lost motivation to go on after first weeks. On the very last day I managed to finish the course.  A bit disappointed.  This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Aniket Bâ¢Jul 17, 2020This course tells us about many services of AWS which are you used for ML and gives a good knowledge when to use , how to use and why to use this services . It would been a much better course if they would have added some labs to it and explained certain concepts of ML .Anyways its a great course .This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Robin Eâ¢Jul 1, 2020Basically a marketing reel of all the various tools in the AWS suite. Slightly informational in the sense that I can now knowledgeably say "oh hey, you can do [that ML activity] pretty easily through a module in AWS" but otherwise this class was not a good use of my time.This is helpful Filled StarFilled StarFilled StarStarStarBy Felipe Câ¢Nov 19, 2019The course is not very well defined. In some things the course is very advanced and goes through stuff quickly and in others it's not advanced enough.Some practical stuff would be nice. I think Amazon could create some sandboxes for learning included in the certificate.This is helpful Chevron Left 1 ... 51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61 Chevron Right
