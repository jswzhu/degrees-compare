You will learn how to prepare for the exam by exploring the examâs topic areas and how they map to SysOps Administration on AWS. You will review sample certification questions in each domain, practice skills with hands-on exercises, test your knowledge with practice question sets, and learn strategies for identifying incorrect responses by interpreting the concepts that are being tested in the exam. At the end of this course you will have all the knowledge and tools to help you identity your strengths and weaknesses in each certification domain areas that are being tested on the certification exam.

The AWS Certified SysOps Administrator â Associate (SOA-C02) exam is intended for system
administrators in a cloud operations role. The exam validates a candidateâs ability to deploy, manage, and
operate workloads on AWS and their ability to complete the following tasks: Support and maintain AWS workloads according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework, perform operations by using the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI, implement security controls to meet compliance requirements, monitor, log, and troubleshoot systems, apply networking concepts (for example, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls), implement architectural requirements (for example, high availability, performance, capacity), perform business continuity and disaster recovery procedures and identify, classify, and remediate incidentsView SyllabusSkills You'll LearnCloud Computing Security, Software Deployment, AWS cloudFrom the lessonWeek 2Welcome to Week 2! This week, you will review relevant concepts and services for Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation (Domain 3) and Monitoring, Logging, and Remediation (Domain 1) so you can get a benchmark of your knowledge in these areas. Question walkthroughs for Domain 3 address the topics of provisioning and maintaining cloud resources, and automating manual or repeatable processes. For Domain 1, question walkthroughs cover using AWS monitoring and logging services, and remediating issues. In addition, this week features optional hands-on exercises for both domains so that you can practice your skills with creating a basic environment and automating with a monitoring solution. Accompanying video walkthroughs show one possible solution for addressing the requirements for each exercise.Introduction to Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation5:05Question Walkthrough: Provision and Maintain Cloud Resources6:45Lab Introduction: Creating a Basic Environment2:36Possible Lab Solution: Creating a Basic Environment8:05Understanding Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation3:11Taught BySeph RobinsonCloud TechnologistBlaine SundrudSenior Technical TrainerTry the Course for FreeTranscriptSelect a languageEnglish- [Blaine] Let's look at a specific question  from the SysOps Administrator Certification Exam.  Together, we'll break it down,  identify the critical parts of the stem,  go through the responses, and find the key.  We will also explore why that response was correct,  along with why the other distractors were not.  Reminder that the questions we use in this course  are at the same difficulty level and structure  as those on the real exam,  but these are not from the real exam.  It's against the terms and conditions  of the AWS Certifications  to share actual exam questions.  It's how the Certification keeps its value.  And we really appreciate  how you are helping to preserve that value for you  and other SysOps administrators around the world.  This question is from Subdomain 3.1:  Provision and maintain cloud resources.  Here's the stem.  A systems administrator is writing a configuration script  that requires the public IP of an Amazon EC2 instance  on which it is run.  How can the administrator obtain the IP address?  I'll show you the answers in a minute,  but, first, let's break down the stem.  What are the key pieces here?  The script requires a public IP of an EC2 instance.  This should be an immediate signal  to remember your networking information.  Every instance can have multiple IP addresses.  They always have a private IP,  and they sometimes have a public IP.  Nowhere else in the stem does it mention  that the public IP may or may not be there,  so we don't have to worry about making sure  that the instance actually has the public IP.  Whatever other systems are in play here,  that part is taken care of.  Let's see.  The script requires the public IP of an instance  on which it is run.  Okay, this matters.  This is not a separate machine. It's not a Lambda instance.  So, we might have some unique tools we can use  to solve the problem,  or there might be some unique barriers we need to overcome.  Last part of the stem: What is actually being asked?  In my opinion, by the way,  this is the most important part of the stem.  And for longer questions,  I'll actually read this part first,  before then reading the entire stem altogether.  Here, how can the administrator  obtain the IP address?  We talked about horses, not zebras.  If you hear hoofbeats in Canada,  you can safely assume you are hearing horses, not zebras.  The obvious answer is almost always the correct answer.  Do not assume any zebras on this part of the stem.  If you are asking:  Are they talking about the public or the private IP?  You're trying to find a zebra.  The only IP discussed before this clause were public IPs,  so even though this sentence does not specify,  go with the previously established pronoun  and note the exam is asking for the public,  and not the private IP.  Cool.  At this point, if you are an experienced SysOps admin,  you likely already have a solution you would use.  Let's take a look at the responses,  and see if any of them match your idea.  A. From the operating system of the EC2 instance.  B. From the instance metadata service  associated with that EC2 instance.  C. From an Elastic IP  that is attached to every EC2 instance.  D. From the metadata associated with the AMI that was used  to launch the EC2 instance.  Take a moment, pause the video if you need,  and select which response is the key, the correct response.  Ready?  The key here is B.  From the instance metadata service  associated with that EC2 instance.  As part of the script you are writing,  you can write a cURL statement to the metadata service  from that instance.  The metadata service, 169.254.169.254,  this is an unroutable IP address,  which means that if you look at the stem,  the critical part, on which it was run, works.  If we were running the script from a Lambda function,  it would fail.  Right, what about the other responses, the distractors?  Remember, distractors must be plausible, but wrong.  So even if you had forgotten about the metadata service,  you should still be able to eliminate the wrong choices.  Response A. From the operating system of the instance.  Right, what's wrong here?  If you query the IP from the OS of a running EC2 instance,  you'll always get an IP address.  You'll get the private IP address,  not the associated public IP address.  If you want the public IP, that method doesn't work.  Response C.  From an Elastic IP that is attached to every EC2 instance.  Now, I actually like this one, at first.  It may not be a best practice to use Elastic IPs in general,  but if you want to always know  the public IP address of an instance,  for example, if you want to pre-approve a public IP address  with a vendor's access list,  EIPs are your best choice here.  The flaw here is attaching this Elastic IP  to every EC2 instance.  Not possible.  An Elastic IP can only be attached  to one instance at a time,  and if you have multiples, this will fail.  Response D. The metadata associated with an AMI  used to launch the instance.  Now, here is where you may get stuck  if you are not familiar enough with the metadata service  because they're absolutely metadata associated with an AMI,  but none of them would include the IP addresses  of the instances that would be built from those AMIs.  So A, C, and D are all distractors,  plausible and yet wrong,  while B is the key for this question.Explore our CatalogJoin for free and get personalized recommendations, updates and offers.Get Started
