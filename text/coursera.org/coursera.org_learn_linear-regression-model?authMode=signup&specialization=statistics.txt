These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio.Flexible deadlinesFlexible deadlinesReset deadlines in accordance to your schedule.Shareable CertificateShareable CertificateEarn a Certificate upon completion100% online100% onlineStart instantly and learn at your own schedule.Beginner LevelBeginner LevelHours to completeApprox. 10 hours to completeAvailable languagesEnglishSubtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, German, Russian, English, SpanishCould your company benefit from training employees on in-demand skills?Try Coursera for BusinessSkills you will gainStatisticsLinear RegressionR ProgrammingRegression AnalysisFlexible deadlinesFlexible deadlinesReset deadlines in accordance to your schedule.Shareable CertificateShareable CertificateEarn a Certificate upon completion100% online100% onlineStart instantly and learn at your own schedule.Beginner LevelBeginner LevelHours to completeApprox. 10 hours to completeAvailable languagesEnglishSubtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, German, Russian, English, SpanishCould your company benefit from training employees on in-demand skills?Try Coursera for BusinessInstructorInstructor rating 4.88/5Â (120 Ratings)Mine Ãetinkaya-RundelAssociate Professor of the PracticeDepartment of Statistical Science 354,730 Learners 7 CoursesOffered byDuke UniversityDuke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
